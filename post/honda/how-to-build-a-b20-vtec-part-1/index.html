    <p>Building a B20 VTEC (aka B20V) isn&rsquo;t much more difficult than building a normal B20 but it can be daunting to figure out what you&rsquo;ll need for parts with so many different options out there. You can do anything from slapping a VTEC head on a stock B20 block and sending it, to going all out with high comp pistons, big cams, and a bunch of headwork.</p>
<p>I figured I&rsquo;d write up a blog series on building my B20V and the reasoning behind all of the decisions to try and help out others with building their own B20V.</p>
<h1>
  Background
  <a href="#background" id="background" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true"><i class="fa fa-link"></i></a>
</h1><p>I recently had my first engine failure and decided to make the best of things by bringing the block back to life as a B20V. The motor was originally a high comp B20B but due to a valve lash adjuster nut getting loose while the engine was running the engine was in need of a rebuild.</p>
<p>The nut left a bunch of dings and scratches inside of the block and even managed to crack a piston.

</a></p>
<p>I had a local machine shop inspect it as a precautionary measure and they said the block was still usable and only needed a bore due to out of round cylinders. I consider myself lucky that none of the metal bits banging around down there damaged the cylinder walls.</p>

  Setting Goals and Making Sure a B20V is a Good Choice
  <a href="#setting-goals-and-making-sure-a-b20v-is-a-good-choice" id="setting-goals-and-making-sure-a-b20v-is-a-good-choice" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true"><i class="fa fa-link"></i></a>
</h1><p>Before diving into building a B20V I spent a lot of time defining what my goals were, and thinking of the different ways I could accomplish them. For one, it&rsquo;s really important to know what the end goals are so you can follow them as your north star, but secondly it&rsquo;s important to know the path you&rsquo;re taking can actually get you there.</p>
<p>My goals for the motor were:</p>
<ul>
<li>200 - 225whp</li>
<li>Maximize the area under the curve</li>
<li>Street drivable</li>
<li>$5,000 budget</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Goal 1: 200 - 225WHP</strong></p>
<p>It cost money to add hp and the faster you try to make a motor than it was stock the more expensive it&rsquo;ll get. 200 - 225whp isn&rsquo;t a crazy high power goal but it&rsquo;s nearing the end of what a <em>reasonable</em> n/a B20V can do.</p>
<p>I say <em>reasonable</em> because it&rsquo;s been proven you can push an n/a B20V past 250whp but at that point you&rsquo;ve likely had to sacrifice some driveability and could have spent less with other build options (aka k-swap, boost, etc&hellip;) due to the prices of b-series parts nowadays.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m happy with 200 - 225whp though as I plan on using this motor for autocross / weekend fun and you don&rsquo;t really need big numbers for that.</p>
<p><strong>Goal 2: Low End Torque over High End Power</strong></p>
<p>I preferred low end over high end for this build because low end tends to be more helpful while out on the autocross course and also makes for a better experience while driving on the streets.</p>
<p><strong>Goal 3: Street Drivable</strong></p>
<p>The car it&rsquo;s going in will be used for more than just racing so I needed the motor to have a normal idle, run on easy acquire fuel, and be reasonable to drive in traffic. This ruled out things like no insane cams with a lopey idle, or no hard to source fuels like e85. (not available where I live)</p>
<p><strong>Goal 4: $5,000 budget</strong></p>
<p>While b series stuff isn&rsquo;t cheap like it used to be and the price of other options like k-swaps has gone way down, a proper k-swap could easily run double my budget after accounting for all the extra bits I&rsquo;d need to complete the swap.</p>
<p>The car I plan on swapping the B20V into is already prepped for a VTEC motor with a VTEC engine harness and a chipped P28 so staying b series let&rsquo;s me put all of the budget into the motor vs accessories.</p>

  A B20V Meets All My Goals
  <a href="#a-b20v-meets-all-my-goals" id="a-b20v-meets-all-my-goals" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true"><i class="fa fa-link"></i></a>
</h2><p>Based on all of the above I&rsquo;m fairly confident a mildly built B20V would be perfect for me.</p>
<p>200 - 225whp should (hopefully) be achievable if I bump up the compression, pop in some stage 2 cams along with upgraded valve springs so I can rev it out, and a good intake manifold / exhaust header to let the engine breath.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll have to keep the compression to a max of 11.5:1 since 91 octane is the best fuel I&rsquo;ll be able to source but that should be more than enough for stage 2 cams.</p>
<p>In terms of cams I&rsquo;ll aim to find a set of cams that focuses on low end power since I&rsquo;m interested in as much area under the curve as possible.</p>
