    <h1 id="finishing-up">Finishing Up</h1>
<p>With winter approaching fast, and my Civic only having summer tires I needed to hurry up and finish the Cherokee. The Civic was also suffering from a stuck open thermostat that ensured the engine temperature never reached operating temp, and my heat was always cold.</p>
<p>The funny thing is, when I was preparing to drop the B20B engine into the Civic I clearly remember thinking how pointless it would be to replace the thermostat. I figured since I never had a thermostat fail on me it was something I could skip over. It was honestly one of the only parts I didn't replace on the engine before install, and looking back I wish I had swapped it out.</p>
<p>This weekend I finally tackled welding in the driver side rocker panel on the Jeep. This is how it looked when I started:</p>

<p>I didn't take too many pictures since it was cold, and I was working outside but it only took me about an hour to weld in the patch.</p>
<p><img src="images/2.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>This side of the Jeep actually wasn't very rusty, and didn't need a patch welded in but I figured if one side had rusted out it wouldn't be long till the other did. I also decided to leave as much of the original metal as possible to make the job easier.</p>
<p><img src="images/3.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>The welds aren't the best, but it's nothing the grinder can't take care of.</p>

<p>After going to town with the angle grinder I had it all prepped for paint.</p>

<p>I decided to use POR-15. I've found it to be the strongest stuff out there that can be brushed on, and it leaves a very durable finish. It's so durable that if you forget to wear gloves like me, it'll leave your hands stained for a couple weeks.</p>

<p>Overview shot. It was getting so dark out that I had to drag out the shop light to finish things up. Thankfully though the Cherokee was ready to be driven and I could finally park the Civic.</p>
