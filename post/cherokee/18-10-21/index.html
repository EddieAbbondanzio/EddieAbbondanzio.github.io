    <h1 id="patching-holes">Patching Holes</h1>
<p>This post is a continuation of the mini series about restoring my old XJ cherokee. In the previous post I talked about <a href="https://eddieabbondanz.io/post/cherokee/18-10-08/">cutting out and welding in a new rocker panel</a>.</p>
<p>Initially the plan for this weekend was to finish welding in the new driver side rocker panel. However, I managed to screw up trimming it to fit and had to order another replacement which wont be in for about a week. To help keep progress moving I decided to finally tackle the &ldquo;little&rdquo; rust hole I spotted in the driver wheel well.</p>
<p>I first noticed this hole when I removed the inner fender liner to replace my dead wiper fluid pumps. I really didn&rsquo;t expect it to be so large, as just the previous summer I had pulled the carpet and cleaned up the inner floor pan and didn&rsquo;t spot any rust that was too horrible.</p>
<p><img src="images/1.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>This is directly after pulling back the carpet and seeing how much metal I could break off by hand. The hole ended up being quite a bit larger than I was expecting, but it wasn&rsquo;t the end of the world.</p>
<p><img src="images/2.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>It looks as if the rust started in the body seam below it. On the inside there was a lot of seam sealer covering it. Perhaps some water managed to work it&rsquo;s way under the seam sealer and rusted out the metal over the years.</p>
<p><img src="images/3.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Like a diseased limb, there&rsquo;s only one way to prevent rust from spreading and that&rsquo;s by chopping it off. A 4&quot; disc on the grinder made quick work of the thin metal. The only thing that I had to be careful about was the interior wire harness which was only inches away from the hole.</p>
<p><img src="images/4.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t realize it at the time but the metal I bought was too thick and a total pain to work with. The patch ended up looking not so great, but it&rsquo;s water proof and solid metal.</p>
<p><img src="images/5.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>The light gray stuff is SEM seam sealer. It&rsquo;s the same stuff that I used on my passenger rocker panel, and it dries in just 10 minutes which is hard to beat!</p>
<p><img src="images/6.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>To finish it off I threw some POR15 over it. I don&rsquo;t really care about the finish since this is going to be hidden behind the plastic fender liner. If I had to do it again (which I do on the passenger side), I would use slightly thinner metal so I could at least work the patch into a more presentable shape before welding it in.</p>
