    <p>Wrapping up the Civic has not been an easy task. The to-do list is basically finished at this point, but since I&rsquo;ve started taking it on short test drives I&rsquo;ve uncovered a few issues that need to be fixed.</p>
<p>Most of the issues that have popped up so far have been fairly minor things such as a moderate oil leak, and a large exhaust leak but I did learn the hard way that my brake booster wasn&rsquo;t compatible with my master cylinder and it was causing the front brakes to drag.</p>

  Taping up the Radio
  <a href="#taping-up-the-radio" id="taping-up-the-radio" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true"><i class="fa fa-link"></i></a>
</h1><p>The tape drive in the radio I bought for the Civic didn&rsquo;t work, and upon opening it up I discovered the drive belt had snapped. A snapped belt isn&rsquo;t an uncommon issue for tapes but there&rsquo;s no listed part number for it so it made things difficult to find a replacement.</p>
<p>Taking some measurements I found the original belt is a 1.2mm x 1.2mm square belt with a 130mm diameter. I wasn&rsquo;t able to find a 130mm diameter belt so I had to settle for a slightly smaller one with a 124mm diameter. I don&rsquo;t anticipate the smaller diameter causing any problems as it&rsquo;s very likely the old belt had stretched from age.</p>
<p>Old vs new.
<a href="./images/1.jpg" target="_blank">
  <img loading="lazy" src="./images/1.jpg" alt="" title="" />
</a></p>
<p>I had to wait about 3 weeks for the new belt to arrive so I did my best to label all the parts of the torn down radio as I knew I&rsquo;d forget how everything went back together.
<a href="./images/2.jpg" target="_blank">
  <img loading="lazy" src="./images/2.jpg" alt="" title="" />
</a></p>
<p>With a bit of experimentation I was able to figure out how the belt was suppose to be routed.
<a href="./images/3.jpg" target="_blank">
  <img loading="lazy" src="./images/3.jpg" alt="" title="" />
</a></p>
<p>When I first tore down the radio the belt fell out of the bottom so I didn&rsquo;t have any reference for how it used to be routed.</p>
<p>Beginning re-assembly.
<a href="./images/4.jpg" target="_blank">
  <img loading="lazy" src="./images/4.jpg" alt="" title="" />
</a></p>
<p>Getting the tape head back into position was somewhat tricky as it has a spring to hold it in place.

<p>Tape drive popped back in. It&rsquo;s only held in via a couple screws.
<a href="./images/7.jpg" target="_blank">
  <img loading="lazy" src="./images/7.jpg" alt="" title="" />
</a></p>
<p>Just to play it safe before re-installing the radio I popped in a cassette to see if things worked.
<a href="./images/8.jpg" target="_blank">
  <img loading="lazy" src="./images/8.jpg" alt="" title="" />
</a></p>
<p>Success!</p>
<p>The radio can load / eject cassettes without issue and fast forward, rewind, and play them too.</p>
<p>All done.

  The Direct Bolt up Cat Was a Bad Idea
  <a href="#the-direct-bolt-up-cat-was-a-bad-idea" id="the-direct-bolt-up-cat-was-a-bad-idea" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true"><i class="fa fa-link"></i></a>
</h1><p>Back when I was working out how to setup my new exhaust I decided to buy a direct bolt up cat to save some time vs fabricating my own setup.
<a href="./images/11.jpg" target="_blank">
  <img loading="lazy" src="./images/11.jpg" alt="" title="" />
</a></p>
<p>This ended up being a mistake for two reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>The pipe diameter is too small since it&rsquo;s meant for a 1.5L engine</li>
<li>The front flange didn&rsquo;t work well with my B series header flange and was leaking</li>
</ol>
<p>I figured my best bet was to ditch the cat and go with a custom setup instead of hacking it up to make it work.</p>
<p>To make the new setup I settled on a Magnaflow 53956, a 2.5&quot; v-band, a 2.25&quot; v-band and some spare 2.25&quot; pipe I had.</p>
<p><a href="./images/10.jpg" target="_blank">
  <img loading="lazy" src="./images/10.jpg" alt="" title="" />
</a></p>
<p>I started off by welding the cat to the mid pipe. The welds aren&rsquo;t the prettiest but I used 409L wire so nothing will rust.
<a href="./images/12.jpg" target="_blank">
  <img loading="lazy" src="./images/12.jpg" alt="" title="" />
</a>
<a href="./images/13.jpg" target="_blank">
  <img loading="lazy" src="./images/13.jpg" alt="" title="" />
</a></p>
<p>Then the midpipe / cat were installed back in the car so I could work out the final missing piece.
<a href="./images/14.jpg" target="_blank">
  <img loading="lazy" src="./images/14.jpg" alt="" title="" />
</a></p>
<p>A bit of cutting and welding later it was done.
<a href="./images/15.jpg" target="_blank">

<p>Re-installed and officially no leaks.

  A Proper Set of Injectors
  <a href="#a-proper-set-of-injectors" id="a-proper-set-of-injectors" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true"><i class="fa fa-link"></i></a>
</h1><p>A month ago when I decided to try and do a first start with the Civic I had installed a beat up set of injectors as the set I had planned on using were out being professionally serviced.</p>
<p>The beat up injectors worked fine for a first start but I&rsquo;m not sure of their condition since they&rsquo;ve likely never been cleaned and 3 were missing pintle caps which is why I wanted to swap them out.</p>
<p>Refurbished ones on the bottom.
<a href="./images/17.jpg" target="_blank">
  <img loading="lazy" src="./images/17.jpg" alt="" title="" />
</a></p>
<p>Swapping injectors on these cars is pretty easy. The main thing to be careful of is the o-ring on the top end of the injector can slip out of place if you&rsquo;re not careful. I lightly lubbed them with a little oil so they wouldn&rsquo;t snag during install.

</a>
<a href="./images/19.jpg" target="_blank">
  <img loading="lazy" src="./images/19.jpg" alt="" title="" />
</a></p>
<p>It&rsquo;s hard to tell if they&rsquo;ll actually make a difference or not but the car started right up with the new ones and it&rsquo;s nice having peace of mind that I shouldn&rsquo;t have to worry about them.

  Learning How to DIY Alignments
  <a href="#learning-how-to-diy-alignments" id="learning-how-to-diy-alignments" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true"><i class="fa fa-link"></i></a>
</h1><p>I&rsquo;m going to need a lot of alignments over the summer between my two cars as I continue to tweak things so I decided to bite the bullet and order a set of alignment hubstands. The most popular hubstands out there are made by Paco Motorsports but they were out of stock due to their recent Black Friday sale that I had missed so I decided to order the DIY kit from Turtle Laboratories.</p>
<p>All in all the Turtle Lab hubstands weren&rsquo;t bad but they&rsquo;ve required some modifications to get them fully functional which was a bit obnoxious.
<a href="./images/22.jpg" target="_blank">
  <img loading="lazy" src="./images/22.jpg" alt="" title="" />
</a></p>
<p>Setting toe, camber, and the rear thrust angle wasn&rsquo;t overly difficult but trying to center the steering wheel was an arduous task. It took me 4 tries before I got the steering wheel reasonably centered.
<a href="./images/23.jpg" target="_blank">
  <img loading="lazy" src="./images/23.jpg" alt="" title="" />
</a></p>
<p>The struggle is worth it though because as I get more practice with doing alignments I suspect I&rsquo;ll get faster at them plus I think I can make some modifications to my equipment to make life easier too.

  I Should Have Bought a Nicer Shifter the First Time
  <a href="#i-should-have-bought-a-nicer-shifter-the-first-time" id="i-should-have-bought-a-nicer-shifter-the-first-time" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true"><i class="fa fa-link"></i></a>
</h1><p>The Megan Racing dual bend shifter I was running didn&rsquo;t feel great. For some reason it was easy to miss shifting into third and get stuck between 1 / 3 and the shifter also took a lot of force since it&rsquo;s a short throw.
<a href="./images/25.jpg" target="_blank">
  <img loading="lazy" src="./images/25.jpg" alt="" title="" />
</a></p>
<p>I couldn&rsquo;t find any normal shifters on the market that weren&rsquo;t short throws so I settled on ordering a K-Tuned shifter. It&rsquo;s a bit too flashy for my taste but I liked that it was fully adjustable so I could set it up to feel like the OEM shifter.</p>
<p>Center console removed to pop out the old shifter.
<a href="./images/26.jpg" target="_blank">
  <img loading="lazy" src="./images/26.jpg" alt="" title="" />
</a></p>
<p>New shifter installed in the linkage.
<a href="./images/27.jpg" target="_blank">
  <img loading="lazy" src="./images/27.jpg" alt="" title="" />
</a></p>
<p>New shifter back in the car.
<a href="./images/28.jpg" target="_blank">

</a></p>
<p>Center console back on.

</a></p>
<p>All done.
<a href="./images/30.jpg" target="_blank">
  <img loading="lazy" src="./images/30.jpg" alt="" title="" />
</a></p>
<p>Overall the new shifter feels pretty nice. It&rsquo;s got a decent amount of throw which I like and it doesn&rsquo;t require too much effort to move around. It&rsquo;s a nice touch having the shift knob sit a little higher than OEM too.</p>

  The Mysterious Oil Leak
  <a href="#the-mysterious-oil-leak" id="the-mysterious-oil-leak" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true"><i class="fa fa-link"></i></a>
</h1><p>The day after the second test drive I noticed there was a small puddle of oil underneath the motor.
<a href="./images/32.jpg" target="_blank">
  <img loading="lazy" src="./images/32.jpg" alt="" title="" />
</a></p>
<p>This was pretty unexpected as most of the seals on the motor were new, but looking up from underneath I could see the lower PS bracket was covered in oil and there was a drop hanging off the bottom of the PS pump.
<a href="./images/31.jpg" target="_blank">
  <img loading="lazy" src="./images/31.jpg" alt="" title="" />
</a></p>
<p>Initially I suspect it was the PS pump so I wiped down all the oil and took a photo of the PS reservoir so I could keep track of how full the reservoir was.</p>
<p>A couple days / few more test drives later I once again checked the PS reservoir but found the fluid level hadn&rsquo;t dropped at all. The car was still leaking though so I figured at this point it had to be motor oil.</p>
<p>Popping off the valve cover I noticed I hadn&rsquo;t added any RTV on the corners by the cam caps like the FSM calls for so I tried adding small blobs and re-installing the gasket.
<a href="./images/33.jpg" target="_blank">
  <img loading="lazy" src="./images/33.jpg" alt="" title="" />
</a></p>
<p>But after letting the RTV cure overnight the leak came back after another test drive.</p>
<p>Unwilling to admit defeat I once again popped the valve cover off and this time peeked down between the inner timing cover and the head to see if I could see any oil leaking from the cam seals.</p>
<p>Yup, the cam seals were definitely leaking.
<a href="./images/34.jpg" target="_blank">
  <img loading="lazy" src="./images/34.jpg" alt="" title="" />
</a></p>
<p>Getting at the cam seals is actually somewhat tricky as you have to remove the crank pulley, timing belt, and cam gears.
<a href="./images/36.jpg" target="_blank">
  <img loading="lazy" src="./images/36.jpg" alt="" title="" />
</a></p>
<p>For replacements I ordered 2 new 91203-PFB-013 seals.
<a href="./images/37.jpg" target="_blank">
  <img loading="lazy" src="./images/37.jpg" alt="" title="" />
</a></p>
<p>I also popped the cam caps off so I could reapply RTV on their mating surfaces to the head just in case.
<a href="./images/38.jpg" target="_blank">
  <img loading="lazy" src="./images/38.jpg" alt="" title="" />
</a></p>
<p>New exhaust cam seal in place.
<a href="./images/39.jpg" target="_blank">
  <img loading="lazy" src="./images/39.jpg" alt="" title="" />
</a></p>
<p>New intake cam seal done.
<a href="./images/40.jpg" target="_blank">
  <img loading="lazy" src="./images/40.jpg" alt="" title="" />
</a></p>
<p>I gave the inner timing belt cover a quick cleaning since it had some oil residue on it.
<a href="./images/41.jpg" target="_blank">
  <img loading="lazy" src="./images/41.jpg" alt="" title="" />
</a></p>
<p>Motor timed back up.
<a href="./images/42.jpg" target="_blank">
  <img loading="lazy" src="./images/42.jpg" alt="" title="" />
</a></p>
<p>Everything all buttoned back up.
<a href="./images/43.jpg" target="_blank">
  <img loading="lazy" src="./images/43.jpg" alt="" title="" />
</a></p>
<p>Three days later and the leak still hasn&rsquo;t returned. I&rsquo;d call that a success.</p>

  Why My Front Brakes Were Dragging
  <a href="#why-my-front-brakes-were-dragging" id="why-my-front-brakes-were-dragging" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true"><i class="fa fa-link"></i></a>
</h1><p>It turns out the brake booster and master cylinder I had installed weren&rsquo;t compatible with each other. I had bought the Integra brake booster used and it had initially came with a 1&quot; MC but I swapped that out for a 15/16&quot; Integra MC as 1&quot; seemed like overkill.</p>
<p>Unfortunately what I didn&rsquo;t realize though was that my brake booster had come off a car with ABS and my 15/16 MC was a non-ABS unit. You can&rsquo;t mix ABS / non-ABS because the brake boosters have different length push rods on them and if you install an ABS BB with a non-ABS MC it&rsquo;ll cause the brakes to drag.</p>
<p>I figured this out the hard way when I took the car on a longer test drive down the highway and noticed it was struggling to hold speed up hills and I could smell something burning.</p>
<p>I wasn&rsquo;t far from home though and was able to limp the car back without needing a tow. My front rotors got hot enough to turn bluish but nothing warped so I&rsquo;d consider myself lucky.
