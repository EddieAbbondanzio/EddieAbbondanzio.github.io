    <p>With the engine back in the bay, I couldn&rsquo;t resist starting to reassemble as much of the car as I could.
<a href="images/1.jpg" target="_blank">
  <img loading="lazy" src="images/1.jpg" alt="" title="" />
</a></p>
<p>Right off the bat the battery tray and wiper fluid reservoir were installed.</p>
<p>I also bolted up the front crash beam but I haven&rsquo;t fully torqued down the bolts yet as I need to test fit the front bumper to know exactly where the beam should sit.
<a href="images/2.jpg" target="_blank">
  <img loading="lazy" src="images/2.jpg" alt="" title="" />
</a></p>
<p>3 new M10x1.25x35mm bolts were used for the rear mount. I had previously tried using 25mm long bolts but these proved to be far too short.
<a href="images/3.jpg" target="_blank">
  <img loading="lazy" src="images/3.jpg" alt="" title="" />
</a></p>
<p>Engine harness re-installed along with the OEM AC delete plug.
<a href="images/7.jpg" target="_blank">
  <img loading="lazy" src="images/7.jpg" alt="" title="" />
</a></p>
<p>The harness is a custom built tuck harness from 2jz off of D-series.org.
<a href="images/8.jpg" target="_blank">
  <img loading="lazy" src="images/8.jpg" alt="" title="" />
</a></p>
<p>Tow hooks secured in place using 3 m10x1.25x25mm flange bolts per side.</p>
<p>The lower radiator brackets are made by ASR.

</a></p>
<p>Hood prop re-installed along with a new grommet + bracket since mine were toast.
<a href="images/11.jpg" target="_blank">
  <img loading="lazy" src="images/11.jpg" alt="" title="" />
</a></p>
<p>One of the new to me power steering lines was completely clogged up so I had to do some surgery to swap in a known good line I had laying around.
<a href="images/12.jpg" target="_blank">

</a>
<a href="images/13.jpg" target="_blank">

<p>Don&rsquo;t mind the color difference.
<a href="images/14.jpg" target="_blank">
  <img loading="lazy" src="images/14.jpg" alt="" title="" />
</a></p>
<p>Lines installed along with the reservoir.

<a href="images/19.jpg" target="_blank">

</a></p>
<p>I was even able to retain the OEM cooling loop.
<a href="images/20.jpg" target="_blank">
  <img loading="lazy" src="images/20.jpg" alt="" title="" />
</a></p>
<p>After that I ran the fuse box wiring through the firewall using one of the new grommets I picked up.
<a href="images/17.jpg" target="_blank">
  <img loading="lazy" src="images/17.jpg" alt="" title="" />
</a></p>
<p>The bays looking pretty good now.

  Goodbye Tein, Hello Koni Yellows / Ground Controls
  <a href="#goodbye-tein-hello-koni-yellows--ground-controls" id="goodbye-tein-hello-koni-yellows--ground-controls" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true"><i class="fa fa-link"></i></a>
</h1><p>Back when I first lowered the car I bought a super cheap set of Teins. They rode as stiff as you&rsquo;d expect and I had no idea what I was running for spring rates.</p>
<p>Since I&rsquo;m getting more serious with Auto-x I wanted an easier to customize setup so I decided ditch them and jump on the Koni yellow / Ground Control bandwagon.
<a href="images/22.jpg" target="_blank">
  <img loading="lazy" src="images/22.jpg" alt="" title="" />
</a></p>
<p>For spring rates the fronts are 400 lbs/in and the rears are 450 lbs/in. This should give the car a relatively balanced feel with a bit of oversteer.</p>
<p>I was very on the fence about running 400/450 or 400/500 but opted to start off at 450 in the rear to see how things felt before I add a big rear sway bar.</p>
<p>Fronts installed.

<a href="images/24.jpg" target="_blank">

<a href="images/26.jpg" target="_blank">

</a></p>
<p>I had a bit of a mishap with the paint in the engine bay when torquing down the front upper control arms.
<a href="images/27.jpg" target="_blank">
  <img loading="lazy" src="images/27.jpg" alt="" title="" />
</a></p>
<p>Even with using a washer underneath the nuts they ripped up the paint pretty badly.
<a href="images/28.jpg" target="_blank">
  <img loading="lazy" src="images/28.jpg" alt="" title="" />
</a></p>
<p>I guess this happens when you spray your paint too thick. I was pretty bummed about it at first but I&rsquo;m not too worried since it&rsquo;s not a show car and this was a valuable lesson to learn.</p>
<p>Once the engine bay is fully assembled I&rsquo;ll go back and touch up any paint that was damaged.</p>

  Clearing Out The Interior
  <a href="#clearing-out-the-interior" id="clearing-out-the-interior" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true"><i class="fa fa-link"></i></a>
</h1><p>For the past couple years I&rsquo;ve been using the interior as storage for some of the larger parts (front bumper, dash, fenders, and more) but it was finally time to clear everything out so I could start working in there.
<a href="images/29.jpg" target="_blank">
  <img loading="lazy" src="images/29.jpg" alt="" title="" />
</a></p>
<p>The blankets are Harbor Freight welding blankets. Back when I was doing the metal work in the engine bay I was worried about sparks finding their way into the cabin through the firewall holes so I covered everything up with the blankets as a safety pre-caution.
<a href="images/30.jpg" target="_blank">
  <img loading="lazy" src="images/30.jpg" alt="" title="" />
</a></p>
<p>Much better all emptied out. I had to vacuum up a ton of blasting media from beneath the front of the carpet.
<a href="images/31.jpg" target="_blank">
  <img loading="lazy" src="images/31.jpg" alt="" title="" />
</a></p>
<p>The inside of the car is so dusty because I used to live on a dirt road. The dust finds it&rsquo;s way into just about everywhere.

  Going Back To A Stock Headliner
  <a href="#going-back-to-a-stock-headliner" id="going-back-to-a-stock-headliner" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true"><i class="fa fa-link"></i></a>
</h1><p>Awhile ago I installed a custom suede headliner but didn&rsquo;t do the best job.
<a href="images/37.jpg" target="_blank">
  <img loading="lazy" src="images/37.jpg" alt="" title="" />
</a></p>
<p>It was wrinkled in several spots, and there were loose sections too.</p>
<p>I also didn&rsquo;t use the proper adhesive which meant it was likely to fail in the summer heat</p>
<p>Not wanting to see it fail shortly after the car makes it back onto the road I decided to go back to the OEM look.</p>
<p>Taking the headliner out was pretty easy since most of the interior was already removed.
<a href="images/38.jpg" target="_blank">
  <img loading="lazy" src="images/38.jpg" alt="" title="" />
</a></p>
<p>Removing the fabric wasn&rsquo;t as easy.
<a href="images/39.jpg" target="_blank">
  <img loading="lazy" src="images/39.jpg" alt="" title="" />
</a></p>
<p>I used a heat gun to warm up the adhesive until it was pliable and then pulled the fabric back to separate it. This worked reasonably well but it was super slow going.</p>
<p>It took about 2 hours to remove all the fabric. And after that I still had a bunch of work ahead of me because now the vinyl was completely covered in old adhesive.
<a href="images/40.jpg" target="_blank">
  <img loading="lazy" src="images/40.jpg" alt="" title="" />
</a></p>
<p>With some testing I found that the adhesive broke down with lacquer thinner and using several plastic razors I was able to pull gooey globs of it off.</p>
<p>Then using a bunch of old microfiber towels and more lacquer thinner I got the headliner back to an almost perfect state.</p>
<p><a href="images/41.jpg" target="_blank">
  <img loading="lazy" src="images/41.jpg" alt="" title="" />
</a></p>
<p>Re-installed along with the sun visors and oh shit handles.
<a href="images/42.jpg" target="_blank">
  <img loading="lazy" src="images/42.jpg" alt="" title="" />
</a></p>
<p>I&rsquo;m still waiting on two new plugs for the center of the headliner to be delivered.

  More Wiring
  <a href="#more-wiring" id="more-wiring" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true"><i class="fa fa-link"></i></a>
</h1><p>As I was trying to put the cabin harness back into place I realized I didn&rsquo;t take nearly enough photos before disassembly. With a bit of trial and error along with trawling the internet for any helpful pictures I could find I was able to figure out where roughly everything used to be.

<a href="images/46.jpg" target="_blank">

  Rebuilding The Door Lock Cylinders
  <a href="#rebuilding-the-door-lock-cylinders" id="rebuilding-the-door-lock-cylinders" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true"><i class="fa fa-link"></i></a>
</h1><p>I&rsquo;m not sure why but the passenger door lock has never worked right with my keys. With a bunch of wiggling you could get it to pop but it was a PITA so a few years ago I blocked off the lock with a dime.</p>
<p>Yes a dime. It was hard to beat the price.
<a href="images/48.jpg" target="_blank">
  <img loading="lazy" src="images/48.jpg" alt="" title="" />
</a>
<a href="images/49.jpg" target="_blank">
  <img loading="lazy" src="images/49.jpg" alt="" title="" />
</a></p>
<p>Wanting to try to get everything functional again I picked up some more lock cylinders that I could salvage parts off of.
<a href="images/50.jpg" target="_blank">
  <img loading="lazy" src="images/50.jpg" alt="" title="" />
</a></p>
<p>I tore down both door lock cylinders down to nothing and cleaned them up good with some brake cleaner to get all the gunk that had built up in them out.</p>
<p>After that I worked on repinning them until my keys worked nicely with them.
<a href="images/51.jpg" target="_blank">
  <img loading="lazy" src="images/51.jpg" alt="" title="" />
</a></p>
<p>A bit of reassembly later and they were good as new!

  Prepping For Power Windows And Locks
  <a href="#prepping-for-power-windows-and-locks" id="prepping-for-power-windows-and-locks" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true"><i class="fa fa-link"></i></a>
</h1><p>The inner doors were pretty messy. The OEM vapor barriers had been ripped to shreds from years of wear so back when the car was repainted I tried replacing them with new plastic and applied a second layer of adhesive over the first.</p>
<p>The replacement vapor barriers ended up being a flop and in the end the door just looked worse.</p>
<p>The silver stuff inside the door is sound deadening. There&rsquo;s actually way two much of it as only 30% coverage is needed.</p>
<p>Using some plastic razors I was able to remove almost all of the old adhesive so I could get a fresh start.</p>
<p>I also decided to remove all of the sound deadening and added just a few new patches.
<a href="images/54.jpg" target="_blank">
  <img loading="lazy" src="images/54.jpg" alt="" title="" />
</a></p>
<p>From there I pulled out the window, window regulator, and door lock so I could switch them out for powered units.</p>
<p>Prior to installing the window regulator I cleaned all the old gunk out of them and lubed them up with fresh white lithium grease.
<a href="images/56.jpg" target="_blank">
  <img loading="lazy" src="images/56.jpg" alt="" title="" />
</a></p>
<p>Much better!
<a href="images/55.jpg" target="_blank">
  <img loading="lazy" src="images/55.jpg" alt="" title="" />
</a></p>
<p>Then I repeated everything on the driver side.
<a href="images/57.jpg" target="_blank">
  <img loading="lazy" src="images/57.jpg" alt="" title="" />
</a></p>
<p>The powered lock actuators and window regulators tested fine but the driver window one was sluggish so I&rsquo;ve ordered a replacement.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m currently working out the final steps for how I plan to wire them and will start that soon.</p>

  Mounting the Fuel Filter and Charcoal Canister Brackets
  <a href="#mounting-the-fuel-filter-and-charcoal-canister-brackets" id="mounting-the-fuel-filter-and-charcoal-canister-brackets" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true"><i class="fa fa-link"></i></a>
</h1><p>With the doors taken care of I jumped back to the engine bay so I could finally install the fuel filter bracket, and charcoal canister bracket.</p>
<p>This was actually pretty easy as all I had to do was cut down my new studs to length and secure them in place.
<a href="images/58.jpg" target="_blank">
  <img loading="lazy" src="images/58.jpg" alt="" title="" />
</a></p>
<p>I added a bit of felt tape to the inner brackets to prevent any squeaks from metal rubbing on metal while driving.
<a href="images/59.jpg" target="_blank">
  <img loading="lazy" src="images/59.jpg" alt="" title="" />
