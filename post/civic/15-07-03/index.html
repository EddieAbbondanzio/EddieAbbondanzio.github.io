  <p>I don&rsquo;t know why, but I&rsquo;ve always been a fan of Honda. I just love the simplicity, and elegant styling. Sure they may not be the most luxurious cars out there but they are reliable and that&rsquo;s a fact.</p>
<p>My first car was a 1999 Acura RL that I purchased from my Grandmother. The car was in rough shape, and needed some love but it was an amazing first car. I put over 36k miles on the car in 3 years, and loved everything about it. It was sleek, all leather interior, and had a nicely sized 3.5 liter under the hood.</p>
<p><a href="images/1.jpg" target="_blank">
  <img loading="lazy" src="images/1.jpg" alt=""  />
</a></p>
<p>You&rsquo;re probably thinking if the car was so nice then why&rsquo;d you sell it? I decided to sell it due to the fact that the car had no after-market support. I enjoy customizing things to my liking, and I wanted a car that could reflect that. I never intended on purchasing my Civic, but I knew I couldn&rsquo;t pass up on the offer when my roommate mentioned his co-worker was selling it.</p>
<p><a href="images/2.jpg" target="_blank">
  <img loading="lazy" src="images/2.jpg" alt=""  />
</a></p>
<p>Dented, rusted, and beat up, the civic was nothing remarkable. The motor in it had blown due to a cracked cylinder wall, and had a 4 speed slush box paired to it. For the price of $300 though, it was hard to pass up.</p>
<p><a href="images/3.jpg" target="_blank">
  <img loading="lazy" src="images/3.jpg" alt=""  />
</a></p>
<p>With just a hair over 100k, the civic was still fairly low mileage for it age. Doing the math, on average it received about 5k miles a year which is only half the milage a normal car travels. It seems like the car was only driven during the summer, especially due to it&rsquo;s lack of rust.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to say removing the engine went easy, but this being my first and my two friends who have only worked on Chevy&rsquo;s it was anything but. After creating a complete mess and roughly 10 hours into it, the engine was finally out.</p>
<p><a href="images/4.jpg" target="_blank">
  <img loading="lazy" src="images/4.jpg" alt=""  />
</a></p>
<p>The civic sat for another two months literally buried in a snow bank until I had an engine ready for it. I ended up pairing a d16b7 with a y8 head to create a mini-me with an ex trans for the shorter gearing. The only mods done were a light weight fly wheel and a &ldquo;stage 1&rdquo; clutch.</p>
<p><a href="images/5.jpg" target="_blank">
  <img loading="lazy" src="images/5.jpg" alt=""  />
</a></p>
<p>After many hours of hard work the motor was finally installed:</p>
<p><a href="images/6.jpg" target="_blank">
  <img loading="lazy" src="images/6.jpg" alt=""  />
</a></p>
<p>Skipping ahead a lot of painful troubleshooting the car took another month / another transmission swap before it could finally be put on the road. I think due to the difference in weight of an auto transmission vs manual transmission it kinda gave the car a lifted look up front. This is after the first drive to work.</p>
<p><a href="images/7.jpg" target="_blank">
  <img loading="lazy" src="images/7.jpg" alt=""  />
</a></p>
<p>Two impulse purchases later, I was the happy owner of a set of Function 7 rear lower control arms and Tein coil overs.</p>
<p><a href="images/8.jpg" target="_blank">
  <img loading="lazy" src="images/8.jpg" alt=""  />
</a></p>
<p>It was exactly what the car needed. I decided to only do a moderate drop since up here in Maine the roads can be quite bumpy at times. I didn&rsquo;t want to have to worry about bottoming out, or scrapping alll the time.</p>
<p><a href="images/9.jpg" target="_blank">
  <img loading="lazy" src="images/9.jpg" alt=""  />
</a></p>
<p>After that I decided to do a wire tuck.</p>
<p><a href="images/10.jpg" target="_blank">
  <img loading="lazy" src="images/10.jpg" alt=""  />
</a>
<a href="images/11.jpg" target="_blank">
  <img loading="lazy" src="images/11.jpg" alt=""  />
</a></p>
<p>Then I decided to buy some Rota slips.</p>
<p><a href="images/12.jpg" target="_blank">
  <img loading="lazy" src="images/12.jpg" alt=""  />
</a></p>
<p>Slips are pretty common but I really like how they pair nicely with the body. I&rsquo;m not interested in arguing about real wheels vs fake wheels, but at the end of the day I couldn&rsquo;t justify spending an obscene amount on them.</p>
