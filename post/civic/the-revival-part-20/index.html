    <p>Planning out how to wire up the headlights and radiator fan took some time as my new fan had a higher amp rating which meant I couldn&rsquo;t use the stock wiring, and the Denji headlights also required beefier wiring since the low beam bulbs are 55 watt.</p>
<p>While the Denji&rsquo;s came with a relay harness I didn&rsquo;t like the idea of using it because it looked cheap and the wiring would clutter up the engine bay. Even worse I&rsquo;d still have to get a second relay harness for the radiator fan that would add yet even more wiring to the bay.</p>
<p>Knowing I could probably come up with a better solution I decided to try and design my own custom relay harness that could run both the headlights and radiator.</p>
<p>I wanted to make sure the wiring was nice and compact so after drawing up my circuit diagram I decided to go with a mini power distribution block to hold all the relays and fuses so everything would be all tidy.
<a href="images/2.jpg" target="_blank">
  <img loading="lazy" src="images/2.jpg" alt="" title="" />
</a></p>
<p>The power distribution block is an 18 position block from <a href="https://ceautoelectricsupply.com/waterproof-power-distribution-centers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CE Electric Supply</a> and it has just enough space to hold 3 relays and fuses which is perfect for my needs.</p>
<p>For relays I&rsquo;m running 1 30amp relay for the radiator fan, and 2 20 amp relays for the headlights (one for lows, one for highs).</p>
<p>The relays I&rsquo;m running are a bit overkill for my needs, but there&rsquo;s no real harm in that. I calculated that each low beam will draw 4.58 amps (55watt bulbs) so if we round up a bit that&rsquo;d be about 10 amps total. The high beam bulbs are only 35 watts but I used the same size relay as the lows in case I ever needed to step up to 55 watt high beam bulbs for some reason.</p>
<p>Long term I plan on doing an HID retrofit with some RX330 projectors I&rsquo;ve had laying around for years so in the future I&rsquo;ll most likely be dropping down to 35 watt low beams but it&rsquo;s nice having options.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a copy of the wiring diagram I made.
<a href="images/13.png" target="_blank">
  <img loading="lazy" src="images/13.png" alt="" title="" />
</a></p>
<p>One thing I liked about the power block is that it takes Metri-Pack 280 terminals which are fairly easy to crimp.
<a href="images/3.jpg" target="_blank">
  <img loading="lazy" src="images/3.jpg" alt="" title="" />
</a></p>
<p>All wired up.
<a href="images/4.jpg" target="_blank">
  <img loading="lazy" src="images/4.jpg" alt="" title="" />
</a></p>
<p>Test fit. I had to bend the mounting bracket it came with as it is designed to mount the block at an outward angle but I wanted it closer to parallel with the mounting surface.
<a href="images/5.jpg" target="_blank">
  <img loading="lazy" src="images/5.jpg" alt="" title="" />
</a></p>
<p>I hid the driver headlight wiring on the backside of the radiator support.
<a href="images/6.jpg" target="_blank">
  <img loading="lazy" src="images/6.jpg" alt="" title="" />
</a></p>
<p>And added a zip tie to the wiring to ensure it never gets too friendly with the PS belt.
<a href="images/7.jpg" target="_blank">
  <img loading="lazy" src="images/7.jpg" alt="" title="" />
</a></p>
<p>All loomed up.
<a href="images/8.jpg" target="_blank">
  <img loading="lazy" src="images/8.jpg" alt="" title="" />
</a></p>
<p>The three relays need to be hooked up the OEM wiring so I ran their signal wires out to the fender so they could be routed into the cabin with the rest of the passenger harness.
<a href="images/9.jpg" target="_blank">
  <img loading="lazy" src="images/9.jpg" alt="" title="" />
</a></p>
<p>I couldn&rsquo;t resist double checking my work with a quick test and was happy to see everything worked perfectly.
<a href="images/10.jpg" target="_blank">
  <img loading="lazy" src="images/10.jpg" alt="" title="" />
</a></p>
<p>Radiator and headlights re-installed.
<a href="images/11.jpg" target="_blank">
  <img loading="lazy" src="images/11.jpg" alt="" title="" />
</a></p>
<p>As a finishing touch I swapped the connector on my SPAL fan to the OEM one.

  Moving on to the Fender Harnesses
  <a href="#moving-on-to-the-fender-harnesses" id="moving-on-to-the-fender-harnesses" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true"><i class="fa fa-link"></i></a>
</h1><p>With the headlights and radiator fan all wired up in the engine bay I was ready to start making the new fender harnesses. I opted to start with the passenger side since it looked to be the easier of the two.
<a href="images/14.jpg" target="_blank">
  <img loading="lazy" src="images/14.jpg" alt="" title="" />
</a></p>
<p>Since I had already ran the low beam, high beam, and radiator fan wires all that was left was to run wiring for the horn, and side marker bulb.</p>
<p>After that I just needed to wire up the ground junction that sits behind the passenger headlight (G201). I don&rsquo;t have the proper terminals for the junction on hand so I had to pilfer them off spare wiring I had and solder them on.
<a href="images/15.jpg" target="_blank">
  <img loading="lazy" src="images/15.jpg" alt="" title="" />
</a></p>
<p>All done.
<a href="images/15b.jpg" target="_blank">
  <img loading="lazy" src="images/15b.jpg" alt="" title="" />
</a></p>
<p>A bit of loom later and the passenger side harness was almost done.
<a href="images/17.jpg" target="_blank">
  <img loading="lazy" src="images/17.jpg" alt="" title="" />
</a></p>
<p>All that was left was to clean up the wiring inside the cabin by terminating it to a connector and then hooking them up the cabin harness.
<a href="images/18.jpg" target="_blank">
  <img loading="lazy" src="images/18.jpg" alt="" title="" />
</a></p>
<p>Terminated and carefully labeled.
<a href="images/19.jpg" target="_blank">
  <img loading="lazy" src="images/19.jpg" alt="" title="" />
</a></p>
<p>New connector installed (the grayish Sumitomo one).
<a href="images/20.jpg" target="_blank">
  <img loading="lazy" src="images/20.jpg" alt="" title="" />
</a></p>
<p>Even though the harness will be hidden behind the fender I like how clean it came out.

  Wiring up the Wipers and Wideband and the Rest of the Driver Side
  <a href="#wiring-up-the-wipers-and-wideband-and-the-rest-of-the-driver-side" id="wiring-up-the-wipers-and-wideband-and-the-rest-of-the-driver-side" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true"><i class="fa fa-link"></i></a>
</h2><p>On the driver side, the harness is more complex because it needs to include the wiring for the wipers, wideband o2, evap purge solenoid, and power steering pressure switch.</p>
<p>Normally the power steering pressure switch and evap purge solenoid wires runs through the engine harness but since I have a tuck harness that doesn&rsquo;t have wiring for them I felt it&rsquo;d be easier to route the wiring through the fender instead of hacking up my engine harness.
<a href="images/22.jpg" target="_blank">
  <img loading="lazy" src="images/22.jpg" alt="" title="" />
</a></p>
<p>At first the harness looked pretty messy but it slowly took shape as I kept working on it.
<a href="images/23.jpg" target="_blank">
  <img loading="lazy" src="images/23.jpg" alt="" title="" />
</a>
<a href="images/24.jpg" target="_blank">
  <img loading="lazy" src="images/24.jpg" alt="" title="" />
</a></p>
<p>I ended up using crimp connectors on the washer fluid pumps because the wiring was so corroded that my solder wouldn&rsquo;t stick to it. I really need to source better pigtails for the pumps but they&rsquo;ll work for now.
<a href="images/25.jpg" target="_blank">
  <img loading="lazy" src="images/25.jpg" alt="" title="" />
</a></p>
<p>Getting closer.
<a href="images/26.jpg" target="_blank">
  <img loading="lazy" src="images/26.jpg" alt="" title="" />
</a>
<a href="images/27.jpg" target="_blank">
  <img loading="lazy" src="images/27.jpg" alt="" title="" />
</a></p>
<p>The wiring for the wideband, evap solenoid and ps switch is ran down the firewall on the side of the brake booster.
<a href="images/28.jpg" target="_blank">
  <img loading="lazy" src="images/28.jpg" alt="" title="" />
</a></p>
<p>It&rsquo;s hard to get a good picture of everything back there because it&rsquo;s tight.
<a href="images/29.jpg" target="_blank">
  <img loading="lazy" src="images/29.jpg" alt="" title="" />
</a></p>
<p>Loomed up.
<a href="images/30.jpg" target="_blank">

</a>
<a href="images/32.jpg" target="_blank">
  <img loading="lazy" src="images/32.jpg" alt="" title="" />
</a></p>
<p>And with the wiring all done in the cowl area I was safe to finally mount up my wiper cowl and wiper arms.
<a href="images/33.jpg" target="_blank">
  <img loading="lazy" src="images/33.jpg" alt="" title="" />
</a></p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have the best picture of how I terminated the driver side harness, but it just runs to C301 within the cabin.
<a href="images/33b.jpg" target="_blank">
  <img loading="lazy" src="images/33b.jpg" alt="" title="" />
</a></p>
<p>I pinned the evap solenoid wire and PS switch wire to two unused terminals on C301 so I could run new wires through the cabin harness over to the ECU on the passenger side of the car.</p>

  Going for Broke and Wiring up the Power Doors
  <a href="#going-for-broke-and-wiring-up-the-power-doors" id="going-for-broke-and-wiring-up-the-power-doors" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true"><i class="fa fa-link"></i></a>
</h1><p>Planning out how to wire up the power doors took me multiple nights of digging through the electrical troubleshooting manual slowly tracing wires through the various diagrams of each sub-system until I was able to draw up one complete diagram.
<a href="images/34.png" target="_blank">
  <img loading="lazy" src="images/34.png" alt="" title="" />
</a></p>
<p>It was far more work than I imagined, and I had to double check all of my work several times but I&rsquo;m pretty proud of how it came out.</p>
<p>Of course drawing up the diagram was only the first step. Now I actually had to run the wires!</p>
<p>I decided to start with the passenger door since it has less wiring, and began by running the power mirror wires as they are the longest and it gave me a good sense of how to route the wiring. Then I added more and more wires while slowly repositioning things until the harness took shape.
<a href="images/35.jpg" target="_blank">
  <img loading="lazy" src="images/35.jpg" alt="" title="" />
</a></p>
<p>I also did my best to secure the harness to the inner door with clips so it wouldn&rsquo;t be all loose and banging around.
<a href="images/36.jpg" target="_blank">
  <img loading="lazy" src="images/36.jpg" alt="" title="" />
</a></p>
<p>For passing the wiring through the door I had to settle on using a round grommet because I couldn&rsquo;t find anyone selling a 25mm x 45mm rectangular grommet. Using a round grommet doesn&rsquo;t quite cover the opening, but it does fits nice and snug. I may explore 3d printing an adapter plate to improve this.
<a href="images/37.jpg" target="_blank">
  <img loading="lazy" src="images/37.jpg" alt="" title="" />
</a></p>
<p>Getting the wiring ready to pass into the cabin.
<a href="images/38.jpg" target="_blank">
  <img loading="lazy" src="images/38.jpg" alt="" title="" />
</a></p>
<p>All done. I used a power door grommet from an EK for the cabin side. (EG / EK grommets are the same, but no one was selling an EG one)
<a href="images/39.jpg" target="_blank">
  <img loading="lazy" src="images/39.jpg" alt="" title="" />
</a></p>
<p>On the inside I terminated the wiring to another 14 pin Sumitomo connector.
<a href="images/40.jpg" target="_blank">
  <img loading="lazy" src="images/40.jpg" alt="" title="" />
</a></p>
<p>And of course I can&rsquo;t forget to mention the speaker. My car never had the OEM speakers nor connectors since I&rsquo;ve owned it so I made some new connector adapters using 2 pin Sumitomo connectors I had laying around.
<a href="images/41.jpg" target="_blank">
  <img loading="lazy" src="images/41.jpg" alt="" title="" />
</a></p>
<p>Passenger door basically ready for testing at this point.
<a href="images/42.jpg" target="_blank">
  <img loading="lazy" src="images/42.jpg" alt="" title="" />
</a></p>
<p>I popped on the door panel to ensure my wiring wasn&rsquo;t hitting anything. Plus I just wanted to see how it looked.
<a href="images/43.jpg" target="_blank">
  <img loading="lazy" src="images/43.jpg" alt="" title="" />
</a></p>
<p>With the passenger door all done, it was time to move over to the driver door. Once again I started by running the mirror wiring to get an idea of where to route the harness.
<a href="images/44.jpg" target="_blank">
  <img loading="lazy" src="images/44.jpg" alt="" title="" />
</a></p>
<p>A bunch of work later and the harness was looking pretty respectable.
<a href="images/45.jpg" target="_blank">
  <img loading="lazy" src="images/45.jpg" alt="" title="" />
</a></p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of ground wires that need to be joined together within the door so I used a junction connector (the blue thingy) that I cut off a spare dash harness.
<a href="images/46.jpg" target="_blank">
  <img loading="lazy" src="images/46.jpg" alt="" title="" />
</a>
<a href="images/47.jpg" target="_blank">
  <img loading="lazy" src="images/47.jpg" alt="" title="" />
</a></p>
<p>Even though there&rsquo;s only 3 more wires that run from the driver door to the cabin than the passenger door it sure felt like a lot more wiring.
<a href="images/48.jpg" target="_blank">
  <img loading="lazy" src="images/48.jpg" alt="" title="" />
</a>
<a href="images/49.jpg" target="_blank">
  <img loading="lazy" src="images/49.jpg" alt="" title="" />
</a></p>
<p>It was a pain trying to finagle the wiring through both grommets.
<a href="images/50.jpg" target="_blank">
  <img loading="lazy" src="images/50.jpg" alt="" title="" />
</a>
<a href="images/51.jpg" target="_blank">
  <img loading="lazy" src="images/51.jpg" alt="" title="" />
</a></p>
<p>But once I got it into the cabin all that was left was to pin up a new connector.
<a href="images/52.jpg" target="_blank">
  <img loading="lazy" src="images/52.jpg" alt="" title="" />
</a>
<a href="images/53.jpg" target="_blank">

<p>Test fitting the driver door panel.

<a href="images/55.jpg" target="_blank">
  <img loading="lazy" src="images/55.jpg" alt="" title="" />

  Making a New License Plate Bracket and &ldquo;Fixing&rdquo; the Crack in the Bumper

</h1><p>Needing a break from all the wiring I decided to pivot over to fixing up the front bumper.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s had a crack in it for several years now and since I don&rsquo;t have the desire or time to fix it properly I opted to make a brace to secure it in the mean time.
<a href="images/57.jpg" target="_blank">
  <img loading="lazy" src="images/57.jpg" alt="" title="" />
</a></p>
<p>The bolts have large fender washers on the backside so they shouldn&rsquo;t rip through the bumper.
<a href="images/58.jpg" target="_blank">
  <img loading="lazy" src="images/58.jpg" alt="" title="" />
</a></p>
<p>I also decided to remake my cheap license plate bracket as the current one on the car was plastic and I worried one good cone hit and it&rsquo;d shatter.
<a href="images/59.jpg" target="_blank">
  <img loading="lazy" src="images/59.jpg" alt="" title="" />
</a></p>
<p>Using some 1/8 aluminum plate I mimicked the design and made my new bracket a little beefier just to be safe.

  <img loading="lazy" src="images/60.jpg" alt="" title="" />

</a></p>
<p>Mounted up. There&rsquo;s a backing plate on the other side of the bumper where the two bolts pass through so it should be nice and secure.
<a href="images/63.jpg" target="_blank">
