  <p>The Cherokee strikes again. A couple weeks back when my exhaust snapped just before the catalytic converter I noticed my muffler had a minor leak. It wasn&rsquo;t anything major and wasn&rsquo;t loud so I figured I could probably just run it till spring and deal with it when it was warmer out.</p>
<p>The Jeep had other plans though as the leak grew in size, and became extremely obnoxious. Due to the internals of the muffler rusting and coming loose, the muffler developed a horrendous rattle that sounded like a trumpet blasting a low note when at 2300RPM.</p>
<p><a href="images/intro.gif" target="_blank">

</a></p>
<p>At first I thought about purchasing a cat-back exhaust set up but the prices were all $500+ which was well above what I wanted to spend. Thanks to the advice from a friend though I realized I could buy just the tail pipe section and pair it with a muffler. Going with this option I ended up only having to spend $225.</p>
<h2 id="parts-ordered">Parts Ordered</h2>
<ul>
<li>Borla ProXS Muffler (40351) ~$90</li>
<li>Dynomax Tail Pipe (55014) $96.78</li>
<li>2.25&quot; Generic Exhaust Clamp $3.15</li>
<li>1.5' of 2.25&quot; piping with a 90* bend. $16</li>
</ul>

  <img loading="lazy" src="images/2.jpg" alt=""  />
</a></p>
<p>If you plan on following my footsteps I&rsquo;d recommend ordering the Borla muffler with part number 400478 instead. I didn&rsquo;t realize the stock muffler had a centered inlet with an offset outlet. The muffler I ended up using had a offset inlet but I made it work.</p>
<p>Using a jigsaw it didn&rsquo;t take long to cut out the stock muffler. The pipe had already rusted out where I made the cut and there wasn&rsquo;t much metal left.</p>
<p><a href="images/3.jpg" target="_blank">
  <img loading="lazy" src="images/3.jpg" alt=""  />
</a></p>
<p>The previous owner really spared no expense picking this set up. I don&rsquo;t think they could have found a cheaper set up.</p>
<p><a href="images/4.jpg" target="_blank">

</a></p>
<p>As I mentioned before, I ordered the wrong muffler but with no other options and needing to fix it ASAP I had to make it work. The local Meineke was awesome and bent me a 90* bend on a piece of pipe. I then took the bend and cut it in half to create 2 45* bends and weld them together. This little offset adapter allowed me to reposition the pipe to mate the cat to the muffler.</p>
<p><a href="images/5.jpg" target="_blank">
  <img loading="lazy" src="images/5.jpg" alt=""  />
</a></p>
<p>Offset adapter in action. It almost looks like I know what I&rsquo;m doing.</p>
<p><a href="images/6.jpg" target="_blank">
  <img loading="lazy" src="images/6.jpg" alt=""  />
</a></p>
<p>After tack welding the adapter to the muffler I pulled it out from under the Jeep so I could weld them together. Every weld received a quick blast of <s>BBQ grill</s> high temp paint to prevent rust.</p>
<p><a href="images/7.jpg" target="_blank">
  <img loading="lazy" src="images/7.jpg" alt=""  />
</a></p>
<p>I ended up having to remove the passenger rear wheel to weld up the tail pipe to the muffler. My welds are on the heavy side because I was paranoid about leaks.
<a href="images/8.jpg" target="_blank">
  <img loading="lazy" src="images/8.jpg" alt=""  />
</a></p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the adapter fully welded into place. Not too bad.</p>
<p><a href="images/9.jpg" target="_blank">

</a></p>
<p>I like how the muffler tucks up into the body pretty nicely.</p>
<p><a href="images/10.jpg" target="_blank">
  <img loading="lazy" src="images/10.jpg" alt=""  />
</a></p>
<p>The polished chrome tip is a nice touch too. The picture seems to make it feel out of place but in person it looks better. I&rsquo;m not the biggest fan of clamped on exhaust tips so it was nice to see this one was already directly welded to the pipe.</p>

</a></p>
<p>Sound wise it&rsquo;s actually quieter than I expected. That&rsquo;s a good thing though as I didn&rsquo;t want to make the Jeep obnoxious to drive. I really like the tone of the muffler as it&rsquo;s not over the top and sounds nice and deep. It&rsquo;s probably as close to a V8 rumble one could get a I6 to sound like. I would definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a nice little upgrade.</p>
<p>This was a fun little experience as I&rsquo;ve never done any exhaust work before but my fingers are crossed I can make it to spring without any more repairs.</p>
