    <p>Even though I&rsquo;m making progress it sure feels like the parts pile is getting bigger as each week passes.
<a href="images/1.jpg" target="_blank">
  <img loading="lazy" src="images/1.jpg" alt="" title="" />
</a></p>
<p>The doors on the left are the old ones and will eventually be scrapped once I remove all the parts I want to salvage off them, but everything else is waiting to be installed. I also still need to order fenders.</p>

  Patching the B Pillar
  <a href="#patching-the-b-pillar" id="patching-the-b-pillar" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true"><i class="fa fa-link"></i></a>
</h1><p>The bottom of the B pillar between the two doors was in pretty rough shape, but I really wanted to try to save it.</p>
<p>I figured cutting out the rusted portions and welding in patches would save me 4 - 6 hours of work vs if I built a new one from scratch.</p>
<p>I started off by cutting out all the rusty metal surrounding where the lower rear door hinge mounts.
<a href="images/2.jpg" target="_blank">
  <img loading="lazy" src="images/2.jpg" alt="" title="" />
</a></p>
<p>Then I made a patch out of 18ga to weld in.
<a href="images/3.jpg" target="_blank">
  <img loading="lazy" src="images/3.jpg" alt="" title="" />
</a></p>
<p>Once welded in, I used a die grinder to rough in the hole and finished it up by filing it to shape by hand.
<a href="images/4.jpg" target="_blank">
  <img loading="lazy" src="images/4.jpg" alt="" title="" />
</a></p>
<p>After that I started building the curved sides.

</a>
<a href="images/6.jpg" target="_blank">
  <img loading="lazy" src="images/6.jpg" alt="" title="" />
</a></p>
<p>And lastly, I made a patch to replace the lower portion that was completely missing at this point.

  <img loading="lazy" src="images/7.jpg" alt="" title="" />
</a>
<a href="images/8.jpg" target="_blank">
  <img loading="lazy" src="images/8.jpg" alt="" title="" />
</a></p>
<p>It&rsquo;s gonna need a bit of bodywork to hide the weld seams, but all in all it should look good once finished.

  Patching the C Pillar
  <a href="#patching-the-c-pillar" id="patching-the-c-pillar" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true"><i class="fa fa-link"></i></a>
</h1><p>Building a patch panel for the bottom of the C pillar where the lower quarter panel meets the rocker panel was by far the most difficult piece I&rsquo;ve had to make so far.</p>
<p>It was a fun challenge though, and I&rsquo;m pretty glad I finally got to learn how to use my metal shrinker / stretcher.</p>
<p>I started off with a couple 3&quot;x8&quot; squares and made 2 90* bends in them approximately 3/4&quot; from each edge.</p>
<p>Then using my shrinker / stretcher I curved them until they matched the shape of the body.
<a href="images/13.jpg" target="_blank">
  <img loading="lazy" src="images/13.jpg" alt="" title="" />
</a></p>
<p>For reference I use the metal shrinker / stretcher combo kit Eastwood sells. They&rsquo;re good for up to 18ga.
<a href="images/14.jpg" target="_blank">
  <img loading="lazy" src="images/14.jpg" alt="" title="" />
</a></p>
<p>Once the curve was matched up nicely, I cut off some of the lower lip since I wouldn&rsquo;t need it.
<a href="images/15.jpg" target="_blank">
  <img loading="lazy" src="images/15.jpg" alt="" title="" />
</a></p>
<p>Using another 3&quot;x8&quot; square I made the next portion. It also turned out I cut a bit too much of the lip off from the first piece.
<a href="images/16.jpg" target="_blank">
  <img loading="lazy" src="images/16.jpg" alt="" title="" />
</a></p>
<p>From there I cut a relief in the lower piece so I could bend the left edge outwards and welded in a wedge.
<a href="images/17.jpg" target="_blank">
  <img loading="lazy" src="images/17.jpg" alt="" title="" />
</a></p>
<p><a href="images/18.jpg" target="_blank">
  <img loading="lazy" src="images/18.jpg" alt="" title="" />
</a></p>
<p>All in all, I made mine out of 6 pieces welded together. If I could do it over, I&rsquo;m pretty certain I could make it with just 4 pieces.

  Painting Everything Up
  <a href="#painting-everything-up" id="painting-everything-up" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true"><i class="fa fa-link"></i></a>
</h1><p>One of the nice benefits of doing metal work in the fall is that the humidity around here is pretty low. This means bare metal won&rsquo;t rust as fast when it sits so I get about a week of leeway before I need to paint.</p>
<p>Given it had been about a week since I wrapped up welding in the 2x6 I figured it was time to finally put some paint over all the plug welds I had left bare after having finished welding in the 2x6 rocker.
<a href="images/23.jpg" target="_blank">
  <img loading="lazy" src="images/23.jpg" alt="" title="" />
</a></p>
<p>There was a lot of exposed welds on the backside too.

</a>
<a href="images/25.jpg" target="_blank">
  <img loading="lazy" src="images/25.jpg" alt="" title="" />
</a></p>
<p>Since I already had the paint gun out, I took the time to spray both of my patch pieces for the B and C pillars.

  Spot Welds All Around
  <a href="#spot-welds-all-around" id="spot-welds-all-around" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true"><i class="fa fa-link"></i></a>
</h1><p>I gave the fresh paint an extra day to cure before deciding it was time to start welding in my patches. I find letting the paint sit for a day or so reduces how much of it will catch fire from the heat of the welds.</p>
<p>I used a 3/8&quot; drill bit for all the holes.</p>

  A New Door Hinge for the Rear Door
  <a href="#a-new-door-hinge-for-the-rear-door" id="a-new-door-hinge-for-the-rear-door" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true"><i class="fa fa-link"></i></a>
</h1><p>With all of the pillars finished up, it was time for me to start on the finishing touches. Earlier on when I first started digging into this project I had cut off the lower hinge on the rear door because the rust had done to much damage to it.</p>
<p>Thankfully, I was lucky and managed to snag 4 NOS (new old stock) hinges that a seller had listed on Ebay.
<a href="images/35.jpg" target="_blank">
  <img loading="lazy" src="images/35.jpg" alt="" title="" />
</a></p>
<p>Surprisingly it wasn&rsquo;t actually that hard to position the door. Once I liked the door gaps I put 3 tack welds to hold the door hinge in place so I could open / shut the door to see if it would bind up or anything.</p>
<p>The new hinge felt great and the doors swings so smoothly that it can be opened / shut with just 1 finger.
<a href="images/36.jpg" target="_blank">
  <img loading="lazy" src="images/36.jpg" alt="" title="" />
</a></p>
<p>Since it felt good I figured I may as well make it permanent and officially welded it in.
<a href="images/37.jpg" target="_blank">
  <img loading="lazy" src="images/37.jpg" alt="" title="" />
</a></p>
<p>For reference here&rsquo;s what the old hinge looked like:
<a href="images/37a.jpg" target="_blank">
  <img loading="lazy" src="images/37a.jpg" alt="" title="" />
</a></p>
<p>I added an extra weld on the inner edge of the hinge to make it extra strong.

  Cleaning up the New (to Me) Front Door
  <a href="#cleaning-up-the-new-to-me-front-door" id="cleaning-up-the-new-to-me-front-door" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true"><i class="fa fa-link"></i></a>
</h1><p>There&rsquo;s a story behind how I obtained the new front doors for the Jeep. About 6 months ago, someone posted up on the XJ subreddit that they had a pair of stripped down front doors they were looking to sell for $40. Having been on the hunt for a good pair of doors that I could fix up, I couldn&rsquo;t pass on the deal.
<a href="images/39.jpg" target="_blank">
  <img loading="lazy" src="images/39.jpg" alt="" title="" />
</a></p>
<p>The only catch was that the seller was located in New York which is about a 6 hours drive from here.</p>
<p>The drive didn&rsquo;t deter me though, as I actually like going on road trips and my girlfriend was willing to tag along.</p>
<p>We made a small trip out of it, and camped out in a state park down in New York for the night so we wouldn&rsquo;t have to drive all 12 hours in one day.
<a href="images/40.jpg" target="_blank">
  <img loading="lazy" src="images/40.jpg" alt="" title="" />
</a></p>
<p>All in all, the doors weren&rsquo;t in bad shape. One of them had ants in it, and looked like it had sat outside for awhile but overall they didn&rsquo;t have too much rust.
<a href="images/41.jpg" target="_blank">
  <img loading="lazy" src="images/41.jpg" alt="" title="" />
</a></p>
<p>They did have some dents but that doesn&rsquo;t bug me.
<a href="images/42.jpg" target="_blank">
  <img loading="lazy" src="images/42.jpg" alt="" title="" />
</a></p>
<p>To start cleaning up the passenger door I cut off the lower door skin so I could clean up some of the rust I could see from the inside.</p>
<p>I learned a neat trick for removing door skins with a grinder by grinding away the metal on the edges until you&rsquo;ve worn through the outer layer.
<a href="images/43.jpg" target="_blank">
  <img loading="lazy" src="images/43.jpg" alt="" title="" />
</a></p>
<p>Then you just need to make a cut along the edge you want to stop at.
<a href="images/44.jpg" target="_blank">
  <img loading="lazy" src="images/44.jpg" alt="" title="" />
</a></p>
<p>And just like that, the skin flips open like a lid.
<a href="images/45.jpg" target="_blank">
  <img loading="lazy" src="images/45.jpg" alt="" title="" />
</a></p>
<p>From the outside the door wasn&rsquo;t showing any rust, but when peeking into the inside from the back I could see some rust creeping out from the pinch seam.
<a href="images/46.jpg" target="_blank">
  <img loading="lazy" src="images/46.jpg" alt="" title="" />
</a></p>
<p>What&rsquo;s crazy is that this door still had dirt stuck in it. Prior to cutting it open I used compressed air and my vacuum to remove as much debris as I could.
<a href="images/47.jpg" target="_blank">
  <img loading="lazy" src="images/47.jpg" alt="" title="" />
</a></p>
<p>A bit of work with the sand blaster cleaned everything up nicely though!
<a href="images/48.jpg" target="_blank">
  <img loading="lazy" src="images/48.jpg" alt="" title="" />
</a>
<a href="images/49.jpg" target="_blank">
  <img loading="lazy" src="images/49.jpg" alt="" title="" />
</a></p>
<p>And as fate would have it, I never snagged a picture of the inside of the door once I finished priming it. So let&rsquo;s jump forward in time to welding on the new lower door skin.

  Trim Delete and New Flares
  <a href="#trim-delete-and-new-flares" id="trim-delete-and-new-flares" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true"><i class="fa fa-link"></i></a>
</h1><p>I&rsquo;ve always loved the bare look of XJs without door trim but have never felt comfortable deleting the trim on mine because I was concerned about door dings.</p>
<p>But now that I&rsquo;ve got the 2x6 rocker to protect the door from other car doors I think it&rsquo;s time for me to finally delete the trim.
<a href="images/53.jpg" target="_blank">
  <img loading="lazy" src="images/53.jpg" alt="" title="" />
</a>
<a href="images/54.jpg" target="_blank">

</a>
That looks awesome!
<a href="images/55.jpg" target="_blank">
  <img loading="lazy" src="images/55.jpg" alt="" title="" />
</a></p>
<p>And if you&rsquo;re wondering why I ended my 2x6 rocker at an odd spot below the fender, it&rsquo;s because I had planned on switching to Bushwacker flat flares instead of the OEM ones. They require a bit of trimming to open up the fender so I purposely didn&rsquo;t extend the 2x6 to the end of the fender lip.</p>
<p>When the XJ gets closer to being road ready I plan on bumping up to 31s (or maybe 32s if the flares make them look small).
<a href="images/56.jpg" target="_blank">
  <img loading="lazy" src="images/56.jpg" alt="" title="" />
</a>
<a href="images/57.jpg" target="_blank">
  <img loading="lazy" src="images/57.jpg" alt="" title="" />
</a></p>
<p>I had to do some trimming on the flare mounting bracket, and the flare itself to clear the 2x6.

</a>
<a href="images/59.jpg" target="_blank">
  <img loading="lazy" src="images/59.jpg" alt="" title="" />
</a></p>
<p>Once the flare fit nicely, I trimmed down the 2x6 and gave it a slight angle to compliment the flare.

<p>Using some 16ga I made some braces that could be plug welded to the B pillar and sandwiched between the seam of the outer / inner rocker.

  Revising my Temporary Braces

</h1><p>The old bracing I had welded in to keep the unibody from going out of sqaure, was starting to get in the way, and was also a bit of a chaotic mess so I decided it was time to revise things.

</a></p>
<p>I ended up picking up some 1&quot; 16ga square tube so I could make an X brace by the windshield, and also by the rear quarters.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not able to complete the brace in the rear yet, because the brace is welded to the inner rocker and I haven&rsquo;t replaced the driver side inner rocker yet.

<p>The new bracing will allow me to replace the floor without it getting in the way, and also sets the stage for me to tear into the driver side.</p>

  More Paint
  <a href="#more-paint" id="more-paint" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true"><i class="fa fa-link"></i></a>
</h1><p>After making a royal mess dripping paint down into the lap seams where each pillar meets the rocker, I figured it was time to prep the outer rocker for some paint.</p>

The primer is pretty fresh in the pictures so it should lose some of that sheen over the next 24 hours or so.

<p>Spraying a door hinge isn&rsquo;t as hard as I thought it&rsquo;d be.

<p>While prepping the door for paint I realized the new door skin didn&rsquo;t leave any gap at the corner for water to drain out so I opened them up a bit. I&rsquo;d hate to see water pool up in my door and eventually ruin them all over again.

<p>All in all, I&rsquo;m excited to be wrapping up the passenger side as it&rsquo;s just down the rear quarter / inner wheel well now but I&rsquo;m also partially dreading doing the driver side since it&rsquo;s gonna feel really redundant repeating the whole process.</p>
<p>On the bright side though, I&rsquo;ve been fabricating pieces for the driver side as I worked on the passenger side so it shouldn&rsquo;t take nearly as long to do the other side.</p>
<p><del>I&rsquo;m hoping to have metal work completed by March-ish so I can get started on bodywork.</del></p>
