    <h2 id="going-all-out">Going all out</h2>
<p>This post is a successor to my first attempt at [building a standing desk] ( /post/misc/desk/). Back during college when I built my first desk I didn&rsquo;t have much of a budget since it was a spur of the moment decision. Because of this the solution I came up with ended up being a permanent standing desk built using misc. parts from Lowe&rsquo;s. Ever since graduating from college however, I&rsquo;ve found it less than thrilling to come home and stand at my desk after standing all day at work. I finally decided to bite the bullet and build a custom adjustable desk.</p>
<p>After doing a bit of research and deciding on shooting for a mid grade solution that wouldn&rsquo;t kill my wallet I ended up choosing the Autonous SmartDesk 2. One of the major influencers behind my decision was this very detailed <a href="https://www.btod.com/blog/2017/09/08/autonomous-smartdesk-vs-jarvis-desk/">review</a>.</p>
<p>Since the kit doesn&rsquo;t come with a top I picked up a nice 24&quot;x48&quot; piece of wood from Lowe&rsquo;s and finished it myself. I still had all the stain + polyurethane from the first attempt so total cost for the wood was just shy of $25. I forgot to take a picture before test mounting the brackets but here is the top before starting on it.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="images/1.jpg" alt=""  />
</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t want any bare wood exposed, but at the same time didn&rsquo;t want to make the effort of staining the bottom of the desk since it will always be hidden. The easiest solution seemed to be a quick spray bomb job. One can of semi-gloss black later, and a quick scuff with 240 grit for preparation the bottom was looking quite nice.
<img loading="lazy" src="images/2.jpg" alt=""  />
</p>
<p>Another requirement of mine was that I didn&rsquo;t want an excessive amount of wires showing. I feel as if it is an often overlooked aspect of projects that can leave them from looking their best. My solution was to (hack) modify a metal wire shelf to serve as a nice and slender wire basket in the back of the desk.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="images/3.jpg" alt=""  />
</p>
<p>After that the next step was to wire up the motors and control panel.

</p>
<p>Once everything was all hooked up I flipped over the desk and dragged it into the office to get ready for staining the top. I am very impressed with the quality of the frame as there is no wobble, and fully assembled the desk feels just shy of 75LBs.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="images/5.jpg" alt=""  />
</p>
<p>This piece was my second attempt at staining wood and I&rsquo;m pretty pleased with the outcome. Even though there are some air bubbles trapped in the finish due to my ignorance it ended up looking pretty nice. I purposely went with a semi gloss finish to reduce how much wear it would show over the years.</p>

</p>
<p>Then came the fun part of wiring everything up. I decided to leave a lot of slack in the video cords since my work laptop and personal laptop have their display ports located in different spots. While 95% of the time I&rsquo;ll be using my personal laptop here, I wanted to ensure I&rsquo;d have a nice place to work when I do work from home.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="images/8.jpg" alt=""  />
</p>
<p>Final shots of the desk pushed into it&rsquo;s new home.</p>

<img loading="lazy" src="images/10.jpg" alt=""  />
</p>
<p>Overall this project took about a weekend from start to finish. Out of all the steps though, I&rsquo;d say waiting for the stain and polyurethane to dry was probably the hardest. Due to my stubborness of not wanting to use the instructions I had to disassemble and reassemble a few times, plus I only decided on using loctite after having completed assembly of the frame&hellip;</p>
<p>I feel I made a good choice going with the SmartDesk 2 as it&rsquo;s very quite, and exceptionally sturdy. Plus the price can&rsquo;t be beat.</p>
