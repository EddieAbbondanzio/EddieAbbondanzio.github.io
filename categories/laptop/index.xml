      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been using Windows for as long as I can remember. Back when Windows 2000 was a big deal I remember using it to play Space Cadet pinball although I was never very good at it.
With the rise of Windows 10 it feels as if Microsoft is going downhill and no longer gives you &amp;ldquo;full control&amp;rdquo; of your own computer. My biggest gripe with Windows 10 is the automatic updates that it forces upon you.</description>

      <description>Mo&amp;rsquo; RAM, Mo&amp;rsquo; Problems I use my laptop for a ton of software development. I&amp;rsquo;ve been working on launching a SaaS and I often need to have a development build of the backend running along with the frontend. Both of those and a database and I&amp;rsquo;m easily eating up 5-6 gigabytes of RAM. My laptop is a Dell Inspirion 7559, and it came with 8 gigs of RAM from the factory.</description>
