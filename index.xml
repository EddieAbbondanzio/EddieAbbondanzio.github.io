      <description>The OEM bell housing bolts are too short for an engine stand so you&amp;rsquo;ll need to pick up some longer bolts.
Every engine stand is a little different but for the HF engine stand I used:</description>

      <description>Having just passed 215k miles, the XJ from Colorado has proven to be a reliable daily over the past few months. It did have a recent incident with the alternator intermittently failing where it&amp;rsquo;d just stop charging and the &amp;ldquo;check gauges&amp;rdquo; light would come on but that was an easy fix by swapping in the spare alternator I had laying around.</description>

      <description>The Integra has been a fun project but after 4 years of ownership I decided it was time to sell and as of last weekend it&amp;rsquo;s no longer mine. For the past several months it hasn&amp;rsquo;t seen much use and I don&amp;rsquo;t see that changing as my XJ from Colorado is my new daily.</description>

      <title>Centered vs Offset AW4 Transmission Mounts</title>

      <description>There&amp;rsquo;s two different versions of the transmission mount for XJs that came with the AW4 automatic transmission and they&amp;rsquo;re commonly referred to as centered, and offset.

The offset mount (top one in picture above) can be found in 1999 and older XJs.</description>

      <description>If you&amp;rsquo;re tired of the rear drum brakes on your XJ it&amp;rsquo;s easy to swap to rear disks using ZJ (93-98 Grand Cherokee) brakes. Just like some XJs, ZJs have a Dana 35 rear axle and some of the ZJs were built with rear disk brakes which is why the parts will bolt up.</description>

      <title>97-01 XJ Interior Bulb Sizes for LEDs</title>
      <link>https://eddieabbondanz.io/post/xj-info/xj-interior-bulb-sizes-for-leds/</link>

      <description>Converting the interior lights of a 97-01 XJ to LEDs is easy since there&amp;rsquo;s only 12 bulbs to swap. Plus LEDs are drastically brighter than the stock incandescent bulbs so it&amp;rsquo;ll help improve visibility at night, and they won&amp;rsquo;t turn your interior plastic brittle or burn your fingers.</description>

      <guid>https://eddieabbondanz.io/post/oemplus-xj-build/3-repairing-the-roof-and-quarters/</guid>
      <description>At this point the XJ was mechanically solid but in desperate need of some cosmetic work. 
It was hard deciding where to draw the line in terms of what I&amp;rsquo;d work on vs what I&amp;rsquo;d leave as-is but I settled on repairing both quarter panels, and the roof as they were the worst.</description>

      <description>I don&amp;rsquo;t use the locks on my HF 5 drawer carts and wanted to free up some extra space so I decided to delete them. This was a fairly easy mod to do since the parts are held in by small rivets that can be drilled out.</description>

      <description>In order to hit my power goals of 200 - 225whp, the B20V I&amp;rsquo;m building will need some mods to get there. Originally my block was a high compression B20B that had the better PHK pistons but the cylinders were out of round and had to be bored 0.</description>

      <description>Building a B20 VTEC (aka B20V) isn&amp;rsquo;t much more difficult than building a normal B20 but it can be daunting to figure out what you&amp;rsquo;ll need for parts with so many different options out there.</description>

      <title>OBD0 Check Engine Light Codes</title>

      <guid>https://eddieabbondanz.io/post/honda/obd0-cel-codes/</guid>
      <description>Reading CEL codes for an OBD0 Honda is easy since you don&amp;rsquo;t need to jump a service connector like the OBD1 Hondas, but you do need to find the ECU so you can count how many times the red LED in the ECU blinks.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve got a growing collection of nuts and bolts and started using the 20 bin storage cases (SKU: 93928) that Harbor Freight sells to keep them all organized. 
The bins work great for all my larger hardware such as some of my Honda bolts:</description>

      <title>AN Transmission Lines Upgrade with Aftermarket Trans Cooler</title>
      <link>https://eddieabbondanz.io/post/xj-info/an-transmission-lines-with-cooler/</link>

      <guid>https://eddieabbondanz.io/post/xj-info/an-transmission-lines-with-cooler/</guid>
      <description>The OEM transmission lines on XJs can be difficult to work with due to their quick disconnect fittings, and the lines themselves are known to leak due to rusting out. Swapping out the OEM lines for AN lines isn&amp;rsquo;t overly difficult, and it&amp;rsquo;s easy to add a transmission cooler while you&amp;rsquo;re doing the lines.</description>

      <description>The ZJ steering upgrade is a cheap and easy bolt-on mod that&amp;rsquo;ll beef up your XJ&amp;rsquo;s steering. The upgrade shouldn&amp;rsquo;t take more than a few hours of labor, and parts are super easy to source since they&amp;rsquo;re from a 93 - 98 Grand Cherokee, and can be purchased from sites like RockAuto, or your local auto parts store.</description>

      <description>Old Man Emu is a great choice for lifting your XJ, but hunting down the correct part numbers can be difficult. I spent the last couple weeks DIYing a lift for my second XJ so I figured I&amp;rsquo;d post up everything I found.</description>

      <title>How to tell if a B20B is high compression</title>
      <link>https://eddieabbondanz.io/post/honda/low-comp-or-high-comp-b20b/</link>

      <guid>https://eddieabbondanz.io/post/honda/low-comp-or-high-comp-b20b/</guid>
      <description>The B20B came in a few different versions. There&amp;rsquo;s a low compression one, a high compression one, and a third variant with the P8R head.
Distinguishing a low comp engine from a high comp engine is a little tricky since they don&amp;rsquo;t have any obvious markings but there is two things you can check.</description>

      <description>I can&amp;rsquo;t believe it&amp;rsquo;s a been a year since I last worked on the XJ. When I first paused working on the XJ to get my EG hatch back on the road I didn&amp;rsquo;t think it&amp;rsquo;d be for more a few months but sure enough here we are a year later.</description>

      <description>After 9 months of work the Civic is just about done! It feels pretty weird knowing I&amp;rsquo;ll be shifting focus to another project after spending so much time on it. I&amp;rsquo;m not 100% sure what I&amp;rsquo;ll pivot to next, but I&amp;rsquo;m most likely going to work on the Integra next as it needs a major tune up to be ready for the 2024 autocross season.</description>

      <description>Converting an EG Civic from manual to power windows, locks, and mirrors by building your own wiring harnesses is a moderately challenging task as it&amp;rsquo;ll require you to pull the dash, gut the doors, remove the fenders, dig into the main cabin harness, and get overly familiar with the wiring of the car, but it&amp;rsquo;s definitely doable and the results are well worth it.</description>

      <description>The two biggest lessons I&amp;rsquo;ve learned from all the wiring I&amp;rsquo;ve been doing on the Civic are to always double check your work at each step, and try to wire at a desk whenever possible instead of kneeling next to, or inside a car.</description>

      <title>Revival of the Hatch Part 20: Wiring Some DIY Headlight / Radiator Relay Harnesses and Power Door Harnesses </title>

      <description>Planning out how to wire up the headlights and radiator fan took some time as my new fan had a higher amp rating which meant I couldn&amp;rsquo;t use the stock wiring, and the Denji headlights also required beefier wiring since the low beam bulbs are 55 watt.</description>

      <description>The brakes are officially finished on the car and I figured it was time to post up an overview of them. Previously the car had DX brakes with drums in the rear that were a horrible eyesore, but since I had been wanting brakes with more oomph, it was a no brainer to switch over to a full EX / Integra setup.</description>

      <title>Revival of the Hatch Part 17: Cleaning up the Cabin Harness and Installing Hood Pins</title>

      <description>The cabin harness has been giving me some grief because there&amp;rsquo;s too much wiring underneath where the dash will sit and it&amp;rsquo;s preventing the HVAC system from fitting. The main issue is that since the engine is wired up via a standalone engine harness there&amp;rsquo;s a lot of unused connectors and wires sitting inside the cabin.</description>

      <description>Having spent so much time on bodywork when prepping the engine bay for paint, I&amp;rsquo;ve been resisting doing anymore of it just because I&amp;rsquo;m somewhat burnt out from it.
Sadly though I&amp;rsquo;ve come to realize the remaining bodywork that needs to be done in the engine bay, roof gutters, and hatch area is blocking almost all of the other work I need to do on it so I had to bite the bullet and finally finish it up.</description>

      <description>I couldn&amp;rsquo;t resist splurging and picking up a set of Denji headlights for the hatch. 
The OEM headlights aren&amp;rsquo;t that bad with their light output for halogen units, but I wanted a set of Denji&amp;rsquo;s because I plan on eventually doing a HID projector retrofit with a set of RX-330 projectors I&amp;rsquo;ve had laying around for years and Denji&amp;rsquo;s are perfect for that.</description>

      <description>As of lately it&amp;rsquo;s been hard for me to see the overall progress being made on the hatch because I&amp;rsquo;m working on too many small steps simultaneously.
Unfortunately that&amp;rsquo;s just the nature of the beast when it comes to this phase of a project car as you tend to uncover more and more things that need to be done while working through your TODO list.</description>

      <description>Bodywork is probably my least favorite step when it comes to a project. It takes a ton of time and it often feels like your just going in circles. I&amp;rsquo;m grateful I didn&amp;rsquo;t have to worry about painting the entire vehicle but even just doing the engine bay I spent somewhere around 120 hours on it.</description>

      <description>I made a mistake in the wheel wells. I had initially planned to leave portions of the OEM undercoating since it was so difficult to remove, and would use bed liner to recoat everything else that I had stripped, but I didn&amp;rsquo;t consider how it&amp;rsquo;d be next to impossible to blend the two together.</description>

      <description>In this post we&amp;rsquo;ll continue building out the 2x6 rocker for the passenger side.
 Finishing Up The A Pillar  Before I could weld up the outer rocker I needed to finish the A / B Pillars so I&amp;rsquo;d have something to weld it to.</description>

      <description>With all this metal laying around it was about time I started putting it to use. 
While the 2x6 rocker mod (aka rock sliders) for XJ isn&amp;rsquo;t uncommon by any means, I&amp;rsquo;m planning on taking a slightly different approach in how I tie them into the unibody.</description>

      <description>My new metal brake finally arrived. 
Before settling on the Woodward Fab Boss 16, I spent several hours researching metal brakes and looked at a ton of different models across various manufacturers such as Baileigh, Tennsmith, Grizzly, JET, Eastwood, and Enco.</description>

      <description>Just shy of two years ago now, I embarked on the largest rust repair job I&amp;rsquo;ve ever done on my XJ. It took me several months, but I was able to replace the entire rear cargo floor including the crossmembers, gas tank bracing, and unibody frame rails along with welding in rear frame stiffeners over my newly made frame rails.</description>

      <description>Having driven over 2,500 miles and raced in 2 auto cross events, the Integra has had a few issues pop up along the way, but is still holding strong.
For what it&amp;rsquo;s worth though, the car&amp;rsquo;s never left me stranded and even when the clutch failed I was still able to limp it home.</description>

      <description>The exhaust on my new to me 88 Integra was beyond saving with several holes in the resonator and the muffler having turned questionably brittle. As this is suppose to be a summer daily driver that&amp;rsquo;s pleasant to drive I decided to splurge and build a stainless exhaust setup to save my ears and retain my sanity.</description>

      <description>Everyone knows good code is easy to maintain, but that also means anyone can maintain it. That&amp;rsquo;s no bueno for the individual developer who wants a little job security. Writing overly complex code that nobody else can maintain let alone read, will ensure your company holds onto you, and will give you more bargaining power come raise time.</description>

      <description>The least exciting portion of this project by far was closing up the two holes left in the floor directly below where the rear seat goes. I initally cut these holes in the floor way back at the beginning of the project because I needed to remove the original frame rails.</description>

      <description>Directly below the floor of the XJ in the cargo area sits the gas tank. Tucked tight between the frame rails it rests a mere 1/2&amp;quot; from the floor. The mount for the gas tank is also what braces the floor in the cargo area.</description>

      <description>While LiteNetLib may run on UDP (User Datagram Protocol) which is an unreliable network protocol, LiteNetLib offers multiple delivery methods, some of which even offer &amp;ldquo;reliability&amp;rdquo;. Reliability is in quotes because when latency is high the chance of a packet being dropped is greater than 0 (although still fairly rare).</description>

      <description>With the rise of ASP.NET Core over ASP.NET 4.x, the built in authentication has undergone a shift from role-based access control (RBAC) to claim-based access control (CBAC).

For Web APIs this is useful for automatically resolving dependencies needed by controllers, or if you&amp;rsquo;re a fan of Uncle Bob&amp;rsquo;s Clean Architecture it can be used to inject external dependencies such as the database into the inner layers.</description>

      <description>The Cherokee strikes again. A couple weeks back when my exhaust snapped just before the catalytic converter I noticed my muffler had a minor leak. It wasn&amp;rsquo;t anything major and wasn&amp;rsquo;t loud so I figured I could probably just run it till spring and deal with it when it was warmer out.</description>

      <description>Coming from the .NET world String.Format() was by far my most used function for generating user readable error / log messages. After jumping over to TypeScript, I was bummed to learn that no similar function existed.</description>

      <description>Hyper Text Transfer Protocol (HTTP) powers the web. It&amp;rsquo;s the silent work horse used to carry data between servers and clients, and is the reason why all URLs start with HTTP, or HTTPS.</description>

      <description>HTTP cookies are small bits of text that are included with each HTTP request made from a user&amp;rsquo;s web browser to web servers. HTTP is a stateless protocol which means each requests is treated as a unique command, and no state data is maintained.</description>

      <description>What&amp;rsquo;s so Magical About Magic Strings?  Magic strings are string literals strewn about a code base that apply some kind of limitation to the code. They can be used to filter valid input, constrain parameters, or control the behavior of code.</description>

      <guid>https://eddieabbondanz.io/post/typescript/setting-up-a-typescript-project/</guid>
      <description>For beginners TypeScript is like the carrot on the end of the stick, always just out of reach no matter how hard you try. Everyone touts how it&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;JavaScript that scales&amp;rdquo;, and once you use it you&amp;rsquo;ll never go back.</description>

      <guid>https://eddieabbondanz.io/post/software-design/marker-interfaces/</guid>
      <description>What Are They?  A marker interface is an empty interface (no methods or properties) that is used to identify classes that implement it belong to a special group. Some might argue that this is a code smell, but in certain situations they can be the best solution for constraining types.</description>

      <guid>https://eddieabbondanz.io/post/software-design/magic-numbers/</guid>
      <description>What Are They?  Magic numbers are numbers in code that appear to be arbitrary, but actually serve a purpose. They are commonly described as an anti-pattern as they diminish code quality, and are &amp;ldquo;referred to as breaking one of the oldest rules of programming, dating back to the COBOL, FORTRAN and PL/1 manuals of the 1960s&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <description>What are they?  While it may seem like nothing more than buzz words, dependency injection is a well known principle. In fact, you&amp;rsquo;ve likely used it yourself in the past and just didn&amp;rsquo;t know the technique had a name.</description>

      <guid>https://eddieabbondanz.io/post/software-design/unit-tests-vs-integration-tests/</guid>
      <description>Preface  Unit tests and integration tests are designed to serve two different purposes. They are not meant to substitute each other, and each type has a specific focus. However, developers tend to struggle to determine the border that seperates unit tests and integration tests as there is no set hard limit on either one.</description>

      <guid>https://eddieabbondanz.io/post/software-design/validator-pattern/</guid>
      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s quite typical for a Domain Driven Design (DDD) project to need validation for it&amp;rsquo;s domain models. While it may be sufficient to solve this by adding an IsValid() method to each model, this can cause confusion for the developer by cluttering the model class, and/or by requiring the IsValid() method to be generalized that it covers a large range of validation rules for any situation that may arise.</description>

      <description>Now that I&amp;rsquo;m back at college it&amp;rsquo;s been hard to make progress on the Civic. I do have a slight update to drop as the hood is just about done now.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been quite busy working on the Civic in the past month. I&amp;rsquo;m verfy excited to shared the journey I&amp;rsquo;m embarking on, and can&amp;rsquo;t wait to see how the finished product looks.</description>

      <description>I don&amp;rsquo;t know why, but I&amp;rsquo;ve always been a fan of Honda. I just love the simplicity, and elegant styling. Sure they may not be the most luxurious cars out there but they are reliable and that&amp;rsquo;s a fact.</description>

      <description>The transmission in the Civic was a good deal for the price of $100, but it had a nasty grind anytime you shifted into 3rd gear above 3k RPM. Because of this, and a transmission popping up for sale for $75 bucks I couldn&amp;rsquo;t resist making the switch.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been fairly quiet since I&amp;rsquo;ve just been enjoying the car. I&amp;rsquo;ve moved up North for college and have decided to sell the RL. There&amp;rsquo;s nothing wrong with it I&amp;rsquo;m just bored of it.</description>

      <description>The fog lights were a little too squarish for my taste so I made some custom overlays to give them a slight &amp;ldquo;curve&amp;rdquo;. The grill is also the custom debadged one I made a couple months back.</description>

      <description>With a stock exhaust the car was fairly quiet. I decided it was time to let the 3.5 V6 under the hood make some noise and ordered a Borla exhaust.</description>

      <description>The RL looks nice but a luxury sedan should really have some tint to it. Initially I planned on doing 35% all around but they shipped me the wrong tint so it ended up with 5% in the rear.</description>

      <description>Made a little more progress on the tablet. I&amp;rsquo;m using a Nexus 7 Gen 2 tablet.
 
I had to open up the tablet to solder in wires to the power button.</description>

      <description>In 2002 the RL came with clear corner tail lights. I&amp;rsquo;ve been envious of the since my 1999 features amber corners but tail lights on Ebay are too expensive.</description>

      <description>For 1999 the RL was pretty advanced. It came fitted with a built in GPS system that was probably pretty slick for it&amp;rsquo;s time. However, it hasn&amp;rsquo;t aged too well and is no longer really useful with out of date maps and it&amp;rsquo;s failing hard drive.</description>

      <description>The projector retrofit is finally coming to an end.

There isn&amp;rsquo;t too much gap between the reflector and shroud which isn&amp;rsquo;t too bad.

The new D2S bulbs also came in.</description>

      <description>I decided to re add the defusers over the blinkers. It looks better in my opinion and feels more OEM.
 
Ran into a slight set back. The caps on the back of the headlights are too shallow and will need some modifications.</description>

      <description>I like doing little things to fix things up. The speaker grills on the car are showing their age so I decided to re upholster them to look new again. Left is original, right is new.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve decided to do a projector retrofit. There&amp;rsquo;s nothing wrong with the current headlights I just really like the appeal of the crisp cutoff.

I separated the lense from the headlight house so I could begin to mount things in place.</description>

      <description>I bought my first car off my Grandmother. It&amp;rsquo;s a 1999 Acura 3.5RL in rough condition. I&amp;rsquo;ve owned it for about 3 years now and only done a few small mods to it since.</description>
