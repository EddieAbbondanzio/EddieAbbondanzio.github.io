      <description>Everyone knows good code is easy to maintain, but that also means anyone can maintain it. That&amp;rsquo;s no bueno for the individual developer who wants a little job security. Writing overly complex code that nobody else can maintain let alone read, will ensure your company holds onto you, and will give you more bargaining power come raise time.</description>

      <description>The epoxy primer I used on the underside of my repairs is some pretty good stuff, but I wanted just a hair more protection down there. And after all can you really say you did a rust repair job on your Jeep if bedliner wasn&amp;rsquo;t involved?</description>

      <title>XJ - Ass Cancer Rehab Part 9: Closing Up The Floor</title>

      <guid>https://eddieabbondanz.io/post/xj/ass-cancer-rehab-part-9/</guid>
      <description>The least exciting portion of this project by far was closing up the two holes left in the floor directly below where the rear seat goes. I initally cut these holes in the floor way back at the beginning of the project because I needed to remove the original frame rails.</description>

      <description>One of my biggest concerns about my custom fabricated frame rails was the vertical welds joining the frame sections. Vertical welds like those are a big no no when it comes to frames because they&amp;rsquo;re especially prone to failing.</description>

      <description>The Fuel Neck Housing I&amp;rsquo;ve been ignoring the gaping hole around where the fuel neck passes through the interior to travel down towards the gas tank. I had a feeling it&amp;rsquo;d be easy to fix so I never put much thought into it.</description>

      <description>Building Out The Cargo Floor I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to try to salvage the original cargo area floor from my Jeep. It had rusted through in several spots, and I kinda chopped it up into several pieces because I only removed bits of it as a time when I was fabricating the new frame rails.</description>

      <description>Directly below the floor of the XJ in the cargo area sits the gas tank. Tucked tight between the frame rails it rests a mere 1/2&amp;quot; from the floor. The mount for the gas tank is also what braces the floor in the cargo area.</description>

      <guid>https://eddieabbondanz.io/post/xj/ass-cancer-rehab-part-4/</guid>
      <description>With the frame squared away I needed something that I could mount up the suspension to. The only thing holding in the rear axle at this point was the rear driveshaft and the front mounts of the leaf springs.</description>

      <description>The driver side frame rail was in far worse shape than the passenger side on my XJ. I opted to replace the passenger side first since there&amp;rsquo;s a little less going on on that side.</description>

      <description>Using a metal brake to bend up new frame rails wasn&amp;rsquo;t my plan A. Nor was it plan B. It was actually plan C. I was trying to fix my Jeep on the cheap because this repair wasn&amp;rsquo;t suppose to happen till spring.</description>

      <description>Background I like to joke and say that anyone else would have sent my XJ to the junkyard.
Somedays if I&amp;rsquo;m in an especially sour mood from working on it, I&amp;rsquo;ll joke and say that anyone smart would have sent my XJ to the junkyard.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m a big fan of the async await syntax in ES2017. In my opionion it just feels a lot more natural than and then and then and then&amp;hellip;. I digress. I&amp;rsquo;ll keep this one short.</description>

      <title>Unity - LiteNetLib&#39;s Delivery Methods</title>

      <guid>https://eddieabbondanz.io/post/unity/litenetlib-delivery-methods/</guid>
      <description>While LiteNetLib may run on UDP (User Datagram Protocol) which is an unreliable network protocol, LiteNetLib offers multiple delivery methods, some of which even offer &amp;ldquo;reliability&amp;rdquo;. Reliability is in quotes because when latency is high the chance of a packet being dropped is greater than 0 (although still fairly rare).</description>

      <description>Continuing off the previous post about how to build a basic server / client set up with LiteNetLib it&amp;rsquo;s time to talk about sending data. Because, well, a network set up that doesn&amp;rsquo;t actually send any data is kind of useless.</description>

      <description>LiteNetLib already provides a good example for creating a basic server / client set up in their documents, but if we want to use it with Unity there&amp;rsquo;s a few extra steps we&amp;rsquo;ll need to take.</description>

      <title>ASP.NET Core - Claims Based Authentication: Claims vs Identities vs Principals</title>
      <link>https://eddieabbondanz.io/post/aspnet/claims-based-authentication-claims-identities-principals/</link>

      <guid>https://eddieabbondanz.io/post/aspnet/claims-based-authentication-claims-identities-principals/</guid>
      <description>With the rise of ASP.NET Core over ASP.NET 4.x, the built in authentication has undergone a shift from role-based access control (RBAC) to claim-based access control (CBAC). The most notable change is the User property on HttpContext is now of type ClaimsPrincipal instead of IPrincipal.</description>

      <guid>https://eddieabbondanz.io/post/aspnet/inversion-of-control-containers/</guid>
      <description>ASP.NET Core supports dependency injection directly out of the box. For Web APIs this is useful for automatically resolving dependencies needed by controllers, or if you&amp;rsquo;re a fan of Uncle Bob&amp;rsquo;s Clean Architecture it can be used to inject external dependencies such as the database into the inner layers.</description>

      <description>The Cherokee strikes again. A couple weeks back when my exhaust snapped just before the catalytic converter I noticed my muffler had a minor leak. It wasn&amp;rsquo;t anything major and wasn&amp;rsquo;t loud so I figured I could probably just run it till spring and deal with it when it was warmer out.</description>

      <description>What Are They? HTTP cookies are small bits of text that are included with each HTTP request made from a user&amp;rsquo;s web browser to web servers. HTTP is a stateless protocol which means each requests is treated as a unique command, and no state data is maintained.</description>

      <description>What&amp;rsquo;s so Magical About Magic Strings? Magic strings are string literals strewn about a code base that apply some kind of limitation to the code. They can be used to filter valid input, constrain parameters, or control the behavior of code.</description>

      <description>Summary For beginners TypeScript is like the carrot on the end of the stick, always just out of reach no matter how hard you try. Everyone touts how it&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;JavaScript that scales&amp;rdquo;, and once you use it you&amp;rsquo;ll never go back.</description>

      <guid>https://eddieabbondanz.io/post/software-design/marker-interfaces/</guid>
      <description>What Are They? A marker interface is an empty interface (no methods or properties) that is used to identify classes that implement it belong to a special group. Some might argue that this is a code smell, but in certain situations they can be the best solution for constraining types.</description>

      <guid>https://eddieabbondanz.io/post/software-design/magic-numbers/</guid>
      <description>What Are They? Magic numbers are numbers in code that appear to be arbitrary, but actually serve a purpose. They are commonly described as an anti-pattern as they diminish code quality, and are &amp;ldquo;referred to as breaking one of the oldest rules of programming, dating back to the COBOL, FORTRAN and PL/1 manuals of the 1960s&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <description>Finishing Up With winter approaching fast, and my Civic only having summer tires I needed to hurry up and finish the Cherokee. The Civic was also suffering from a stuck open thermostat that ensured the engine temperature never reached operating temp, and my heat was always cold.</description>

      <title>Software Design - Dependency Injection and Inversion</title>

      <description>What are they? While it may seem like nothing more than buzz words, dependency injection is a well known principle. In fact, you&amp;rsquo;ve likely used it yourself in the past and just didn&amp;rsquo;t know the technique had a name.</description>

      <title>Software Design - Unit Tests vs Integration Tests</title>

      <guid>https://eddieabbondanz.io/post/software-design/unit-tests-vs-integration-tests/</guid>
      <description>Preface Unit tests and integration tests are designed to serve two different purposes. They are not meant to substitute each other, and each type has a specific focus. However, developers tend to struggle to determine the border that seperates unit tests and integration tests as there is no set hard limit on either one.</description>

      <description>Validating Objects Based on Context It&amp;rsquo;s quite typical for a Domain Driven Design (DDD) project to need validation for it&amp;rsquo;s domain models. While it may be sufficient to solve this by adding an IsValid() method to each model, this can cause confusion for the developer by cluttering the model class, and/or by requiring the IsValid() method to be generalized that it covers a large range of validation rules for any situation that may arise.</description>

      <description>The RL looks nice but a luxury sedan should really have some tint to it. Initially I planned on doing 35% all around but they shipped me the wrong tint so it ended up with 5% in the rear.</description>

      <description>Made a little more progress on the tablet. I&amp;rsquo;m using a Nexus 7 Gen 2 tablet.
I had to open up the tablet to solder in wires to the power button.</description>

      <description>In 2002 the RL came with clear corner tail lights. I&amp;rsquo;ve been envious of the since my 1999 features amber corners but tail lights on Ebay are too expensive.
I decided to cut open my tail lights and remove the amber manually.</description>

      <description>For 1999 the RL was pretty advanced. It came fitted with a built in GPS system that was probably pretty slick for it&amp;rsquo;s time. However, it hasn&amp;rsquo;t aged too well and is no longer really useful with out of date maps and it&amp;rsquo;s failing hard drive.</description>

      <description>The projector retrofit is finally coming to an end.
There isn&amp;rsquo;t too much gap between the reflector and shroud which isn&amp;rsquo;t too bad.
The new D2S bulbs also came in. They&amp;rsquo;re much brighter than the D2Rs.</description>

      <description>I decided to re add the defusers over the blinkers. It looks better in my opinion and feels more OEM.
Ran into a slight set back. The caps on the back of the headlights are too shallow and will need some modifications.</description>

      <description>I like doing little things to fix things up. The speaker grills on the car are showing their age so I decided to re upholster them to look new again. Left is original, right is new.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve decided to do a projector retrofit. There&amp;rsquo;s nothing wrong with the current headlights I just really like the appeal of the crisp cutoff.
I separated the lense from the headlight house so I could begin to mount things in place.</description>

      <description>I bought my first car off my Grandmother. It&amp;rsquo;s a 1999 Acura 3.5RL in rough condition. I&amp;rsquo;ve owned it for about 3 years now and only done a few small mods to it since.</description>
