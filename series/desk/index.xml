      <description>Going all out This post is a successor to my first attempt at [building a standing desk] ( /post/misc/desk/). Back during college when I built my first desk I didn&#39;t have much of a budget since it was a spur of the moment decision. Because of this the solution I came up with ended up being a permanent standing desk built using misc. parts from Lowe&#39;s. Ever since graduating from college however, I&#39;ve found it less than thrilling to come home and stand at my desk after standing all day at work.</description>

      <description>My Budget Build At my work, I&#39;m fortunate enough to have one of those adjustable desks that allow for you to stand or sit while you work. Since I almost always have it in the standing mode I decided to build my own standing desk at home. However I&#39;m on a college student budget, and don&#39;t want to spend an arm and a leg right now. In the end I came up with this solution that&#39;s left me pretty happy.</description>
