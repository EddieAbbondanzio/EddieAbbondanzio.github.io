      <description>Delaying the Inevitable When it comes to my cars, I like to bunch up my repairs / mods into batches where I&amp;rsquo;ll focus on one small sub-category of tasks before moving onto the next.</description>

      <title>Installing a Gentex 177 Auto Dimming Rear View Mirror</title>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s hard to explain, but driving a car at night that has an auto dimming rear view mirror is a real treat. It&amp;rsquo;s one of those things that you&amp;rsquo;ll never notice when it&amp;rsquo;s working, but as soon as you don&amp;rsquo;t have it you&amp;rsquo;ll notice its absence immediately.</description>

      <description>The epoxy primer I used on the underside of my repairs is some pretty good stuff, but I wanted just a hair more protection down there. And after all can you really say you did a rust repair job on your Jeep if bedliner wasn&amp;rsquo;t involved?</description>

      <title>Unibody Rust Repair Part 9: Closing Up The Floor</title>

      <description>The least exciting portion of this project by far was closing up the two holes left in the floor directly below where the rear seat goes. I initally cut these holes in the floor way back at the beginning of the project because I needed to remove the original frame rails.</description>

      <title>Unibody Rust Repair Part 8: Welding on Frame Stiffeners</title>

      <description>One of my biggest concerns about my custom fabricated frame rails was the vertical welds joining the frame sections. Vertical welds like those are a big no no when it comes to frames because they&amp;rsquo;re especially prone to failing.</description>

      <title>Unibody Rust Repair Part 7: A New Fuel Neck Housing And Making Cut N Fold Panels</title>

      <description>The Fuel Neck Housing I&amp;rsquo;ve been ignoring the gaping hole around where the fuel neck passes through the interior to travel down towards the gas tank. I had a feeling it&amp;rsquo;d be easy to fix so I never put much thought into it.</description>

      <description>Building Out The Cargo Floor I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to try to salvage the original cargo area floor from my Jeep. It had rusted through in several spots, and I kinda chopped it up into several pieces because I only removed bits of it as a time when I was fabricating the new frame rails.</description>

      <title>Unibody Rust Repair Part 5: Designing A Custom Gas Tank Cradle</title>

      <description>Directly below the floor of the XJ in the cargo area sits the gas tank. Tucked tight between the frame rails it rests a mere 1/2&amp;quot; from the floor. The mount for the gas tank is also what braces the floor in the cargo area.</description>

      <title>Unibody Rust Repair Part 4: Hooking Up The Suspension</title>

      <description>With the frame squared away I needed something that I could mount up the suspension to. The only thing holding in the rear axle at this point was the rear driveshaft and the front mounts of the leaf springs.</description>

      <description>The driver side frame rail was in far worse shape than the passenger side on my XJ. I opted to replace the passenger side first since there&amp;rsquo;s a little less going on on that side.</description>

      <description>Using a metal brake to bend up new frame rails wasn&amp;rsquo;t my plan A. Nor was it plan B. It was actually plan C. I was trying to fix my Jeep on the cheap because this repair wasn&amp;rsquo;t suppose to happen till spring.</description>

      <title>Unibody Rust Repair Part 1: Fabricating A New Rear Crossmember</title>

      <description>Background I like to joke and say that anyone else would have sent my XJ to the junkyard.
My Cherokee is rusty, has a laundry list of issues, gets 17 MPG on the good days, and is literally a brick on wheels.</description>

      <description>The Cherokee strikes again. A couple weeks back when my exhaust snapped just before the catalytic converter I noticed my muffler had a minor leak. It wasn&amp;rsquo;t anything major and wasn&amp;rsquo;t loud so I figured I could probably just run it till spring and deal with it when it was warmer out.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve honestly been very lucky with my Jeep. My previous daily driver was a 2009 Subaru Legacy, and while it may have been excellent in the snow it had a very high cost of ownership.</description>

      <description>Finishing Up With winter approaching fast, and my Civic only having summer tires I needed to hurry up and finish the Cherokee. The Civic was also suffering from a stuck open thermostat that ensured the engine temperature never reached operating temp, and my heat was always cold.</description>

      <description>Repainting the Cherokee&amp;rsquo;s roof I&amp;rsquo;m a big fan of older vehicles. I just love the simplicity of them and how easy they are to work on them. Plus the cost of parts really can&amp;rsquo;t be beat.</description>
