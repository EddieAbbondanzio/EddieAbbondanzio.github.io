      <description>&lt;p&gt;Wrapping up the Civic has not been an easy task. The to-do list is basically finished at this point, but since I&amp;rsquo;ve started taking it on short test drives I&amp;rsquo;ve uncovered a few issues that need to be fixed.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;After 9 months of work the Civic is just about done! It feels pretty weird knowing I&amp;rsquo;ll be shifting focus to another project after spending so much time on it. I&amp;rsquo;m not 100% sure what I&amp;rsquo;ll pivot to next, but I&amp;rsquo;m most likely going to work on the Integra next as it needs a major tune up to be ready for the 2024 autocross season.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Revival of the Hatch Part 21: Jamming out the Cabin Harness so I Can Put the Dash Back In</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The two biggest lessons I&amp;rsquo;ve learned from all the wiring I&amp;rsquo;ve been doing on the Civic are to always double check your work at each step, and try to wire at a desk whenever possible instead of kneeling next to, or inside a car.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Revival of the Hatch Part 20: Wiring Some DIY Headlight / Radiator Relay Harnesses and Power Door Harnesses </title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Planning out how to wire up the headlights and radiator fan took some time as my new fan had a higher amp rating which meant I couldn&amp;rsquo;t use the stock wiring, and the Denji headlights also required beefier wiring since the low beam bulbs are 55 watt.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In an effort to knock down the size of my TODO list I&amp;rsquo;ve been trying to wrap up the exterior of the car. Plus with how close the exterior is to being done I&amp;rsquo;ve been itching to see how the car is gonna look all buttoned up.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Revival of the Hatch Part 18: Finalizing the New Brakes</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The brakes are officially finished on the car and I figured it was time to post up an overview of them. Previously the car had DX brakes with drums in the rear that were a horrible eyesore, but since I had been wanting brakes with more oomph, it was a no brainer to switch over to a full EX / Integra setup.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Revival of the Hatch Part 17: Cleaning up the Cabin Harness and Installing Hood Pins</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The cabin harness has been giving me some grief because there&amp;rsquo;s too much wiring underneath where the dash will sit and it&amp;rsquo;s preventing the HVAC system from fitting. The main issue is that since the engine is wired up via a standalone engine harness there&amp;rsquo;s a lot of unused connectors and wires sitting inside the cabin.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Digging into the smaller details of the car has been pretty enjoyable. Most of the small things I&amp;rsquo;m working on aren&amp;rsquo;t necessary for getting the car back on the road, but it&amp;rsquo;s given me a chance to address all the minor issues the car has had for years.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s a relief having finished up all the bodywork on the Civic but I&amp;rsquo;m starting to feel short on time with the beginning of the race seasoning looming closer and closer. The project is approaching the finish line, but at a high level I still need to:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Having spent so much time on bodywork when prepping the engine bay for paint, I&amp;rsquo;ve been resisting doing anymore of it just because I&amp;rsquo;m somewhat burnt out from it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Sadly though I&amp;rsquo;ve come to realize the remaining bodywork that needs to be done in the engine bay, roof gutters, and hatch area is blocking almost all of the other work I need to do on it so I had to bite the bullet and finally finish it up.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I couldn&amp;rsquo;t resist splurging and picking up a set of Denji headlights for the hatch.&#xA;&lt;div class=&#34;image&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;a href=&#34;images/0.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&#xA;  &lt;img loading=&#34;lazy&#34; src=&#34;images/0.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; title=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&#xA;&lt;/a&gt;&#xA;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The OEM headlights aren&amp;rsquo;t that bad with their light output for halogen units, but I wanted a set of Denji&amp;rsquo;s because I plan on eventually doing a HID projector retrofit with a set of RX-330 projectors I&amp;rsquo;ve had laying around for years and Denji&amp;rsquo;s are perfect for that.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;As of lately it&amp;rsquo;s been hard for me to see the overall progress being made on the hatch because I&amp;rsquo;m working on too many small steps simultaneously.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately that&amp;rsquo;s just the nature of the beast when it comes to this phase of a project car as you tend to uncover more and more things that need to be done while working through your TODO list. It&amp;rsquo;s all too easy to dive into another step before finishing the one your currently on.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;With the engine back in the bay, I couldn&amp;rsquo;t resist starting to reassemble as much of the car as I could.&#xA;&lt;div class=&#34;image&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;a href=&#34;images/1.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&#xA;  &lt;img loading=&#34;lazy&#34; src=&#34;images/1.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; title=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&#xA;&lt;/a&gt;&#xA;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Right off the bat the battery tray and wiper fluid reservoir were installed.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Before dropping in the motor, I wanted to make sure there wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be any surprises during re-assembly so I went through the engine bay and cleaned up every bolt / access hole. I found that a lot of the holes had paint built up in them so I used a couple taps and a deburring tool to clean everything up.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Revival of the Hatch Part 9: Taking the Engine Bay From Primer to Paint and All the Filler Inbetween</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Bodywork is probably my least favorite step when it comes to a project. It takes a ton of time and it often feels like your just going in circles. I&amp;rsquo;m grateful I didn&amp;rsquo;t have to worry about painting the entire vehicle but even just doing the engine bay I spent somewhere around 120 hours on it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Revival of the Hatch Part 8: Raptor Lining the Front Wheel Wells and Finishing the Firewall</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I made a mistake in the wheel wells. I had initially planned to leave portions of the OEM undercoating since it was so difficult to remove, and would use bed liner to recoat everything else that I had stripped, but I didn&amp;rsquo;t consider how it&amp;rsquo;d be next to impossible to blend the two together.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Having finished up the suspension (minus coilovers) I figured the next logical step would be to dive into the engine bay. I&amp;rsquo;m itching to start on the engine bay body work but I felt it&amp;rsquo;d be smarter to address every existing issue, and figure out how/where everything would mount up prior to spraying any paint.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Revival of the Hatch Part 6: Overhauling the Suspension</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The suspension on my hatch was in rough shape. Nearly every bushings was ripped, the ball joints were original and questionable at best, and all of the various suspension arms were covered in rust and some still had over spray on them from when we painted the car years ago.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;With so many spots that needed to be addressed in the engine bay it was hard to pick where to start. To break the ice I decided to start with a small first step of unshaving the headlight adjuster holes that I had accidentally shaved.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Even with the motor and transmission already pulled there was still a good chunk of parts that needed to be removed from the chassis.&#xA;&lt;div class=&#34;image&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;a href=&#34;images/1.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&#xA;  &lt;img loading=&#34;lazy&#34; src=&#34;images/1.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; title=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&#xA;&lt;/a&gt;&#xA;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The ever growing parts pile.&#xA;&lt;div class=&#34;image&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;a href=&#34;images/2.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&#xA;  &lt;img loading=&#34;lazy&#34; src=&#34;images/2.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; title=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&#xA;&lt;/a&gt;&#xA;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The B20B I pulled out of the Civic was still perfectly healthy and didn&amp;rsquo;t really need much.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But I figured why not go the extra mile and repaint it with some proper enamel since the original paint I sprayed had just about burnt off it, and I also wanted to replace a couple gaskets while I was at it.&#xA;&lt;div class=&#34;image&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;a href=&#34;images/1.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&#xA;  &lt;img loading=&#34;lazy&#34; src=&#34;images/1.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; title=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&#xA;&lt;/a&gt;&#xA;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Itching to take a break from all the metal work I&amp;rsquo;ve been doing on my XJ, I decided to start with the transmission for my civic. There&amp;rsquo;s nothing actually wrong with it, but I can&amp;rsquo;t resist adding an LSD to it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve owned my 1993 Civic Hatch for about 10 years now but it&amp;rsquo;s sat neglected in my shop for the last 3. It was my first real project car, and the car I learned how to do almost everything on.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
