      <description>&lt;p&gt;About a month back I was staying at an AirBnB with some buddies for an autocross event when one of them casually mentioned they had a friend with a RSX Type S that had a (potentially) blown transmission just sitting around. They weren&amp;rsquo;t exactly sure what was wrong with it but the owner wasn&amp;rsquo;t mechanically inclined and was just looking to get rid of it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
