      <description>Itching to take a break from all the metal work I&amp;rsquo;ve been doing on my XJ, I decided to start with the transmission for my civic. There&amp;rsquo;s nothing actually wrong with it, but I can&amp;rsquo;t resist adding an LSD to it.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve owned my 1993 Civic Hatch for about 8 years now but it&amp;rsquo;s sat neglected in my shop for the last 3. It was my first real project car, and the car I learned how to do almost everything on.</description>

      <description># Ten months of work finally pays off I enjoy working on my own vehicles but by far the best part is finishing up. While it took longer than I hoped, and the deadlines I kept setting for myself came and went I can say it was worth the wait.</description>

      <description># Getting ready for the test drive While the car may not be on the road yet, it&amp;rsquo;s come quite a bit closer to getting there. Lately I&amp;rsquo;ve been working on fixing everything that was sub-optimally done previously by me.</description>

      <description># Finishing things up With the weather warming up it&amp;rsquo;s been making me miss the civic quite a bit. While it may not be the fastest car out there I do enjoy riving it.</description>

      <description># Connecting the Pieces It&amp;rsquo;s easy to forget just how many parts you&amp;rsquo;ve removed until it comes time to put them all back together. I know I&amp;rsquo;m probably not alone when I say I&amp;rsquo;ve fallen victim to scope creep many times now.</description>

      <description># Getting Closer. I ran into a few set backs this weekend, and I&amp;rsquo;m a little annoyed but at the same time the civic is really close to being done. I started off by prepping the transmission and engine for being mated together.</description>

      <description># Restoring the transmission My girlfriend and I went on a road trip to Vermont to pick up this transmission. Funny enough I wasn&amp;rsquo;t able to find only a transmission so I had to buy a B18b1 engine to get this guy.</description>

      <description># New Transmission Mount Installed Progress wise not too much more has been done on the Civic this week. I had to help out my girlfriend put new front brakes + an oil change so I wasn&amp;rsquo;t feeling too motivated after that.</description>

      <description># Wrapping it up It&amp;rsquo;s funny, you never realize how many things are missing until you try to finish up your project. I spent today going over the motor ensuring I had everything I needed for it.</description>

      <description># I like projects And I&amp;rsquo;m the kind of person that can&amp;rsquo;t leave a car alone. My civic is a 1993 DX hatch that I picked up off a friend of a friend 3 years ago.</description>

      <description>Now that I&amp;rsquo;m back at college it&amp;rsquo;s been hard to make progress on the Civic. I do have a slight update to drop as the hood is just about done now.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been quite busy working on the Civic in the past month. I&amp;rsquo;m verfy excited to shared the journey I&amp;rsquo;m embarking on, and can&amp;rsquo;t wait to see how the finished product looks.</description>

      <description>The transmission in the Civic was a good deal for the price of $100, but it had a nasty grind anytime you shifted into 3rd gear above 3k RPM. Because of this, and a transmission popping up for sale for $75 bucks I couldn&amp;rsquo;t resist making the switch.</description>

      <description>I don&amp;rsquo;t know why, but I&amp;rsquo;ve always been a fan of Honda. I just love the simplicity, and elegant styling. Sure they may not be the most luxurious cars out there but they are reliable and that&amp;rsquo;s a fact.</description>
