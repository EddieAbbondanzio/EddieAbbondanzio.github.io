      <title>Revival of the Hatch Part 13: Denjis and a Custom Radiator Fan Shroud</title>

      <description>I couldn&amp;rsquo;t resist splurging and picking up a set of Denji headlights for the hatch.  
The OEM headlights aren&amp;rsquo;t that bad with their light output for halogen units, but I wanted a set of Denji&amp;rsquo;s because I plan on eventually doing a HID projector retrofit with a set of RX-330 projectors I&amp;rsquo;ve had laying around for years and Denji&amp;rsquo;s are perfect for that.</description>

      <description>As of lately it&amp;rsquo;s been hard for me to see the overall progress being made on the hatch because I&amp;rsquo;m working on too many small steps simultaneously.
Unfortunately that&amp;rsquo;s just the nature of the beast when it comes to this phase of a project car as you tend to uncover more and more things that need to be done while working through your TODO list.</description>

      <description>With the engine back in the bay, I couldn&amp;rsquo;t resist starting to reassemble as much of the car as I could.  
Right off the bat the battery tray and wiper fluid reservoir were installed.</description>

      <description>Before dropping in the motor, I wanted to make sure there wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be any surprises during re-assembly so I went through the engine bay and cleaned up every bolt / access hole.</description>

      <title>Revival of the Hatch Part 9: Taking the Engine Bay From Primer to Paint and All the Filler Inbetween</title>

      <description>Bodywork is probably my least favorite step when it comes to a project. It takes a ton of time and it often feels like your just going in circles. I&amp;rsquo;m grateful I didn&amp;rsquo;t have to worry about painting the entire vehicle but even just doing the engine bay I spent somewhere around 120 hours on it.</description>

      <title>Revival of the Hatch Part 8: Raptor Lining the Front Wheel Wells and Finishing the Firewall</title>
      <link>https://eddieabbondanz.io/post/civic/the-revival-part-8/</link>

      <description>I made a mistake in the wheel wells. I had initially planned to leave portions of the OEM undercoating since it was so difficult to remove, and would use bed liner to recoat everything else that I had stripped, but I didn&amp;rsquo;t consider how it&amp;rsquo;d be next to impossible to blend the two together.</description>

      <title>Revival of the Hatch Part 7: Re-Adding Power Steering, a Full-Sized Radiator and More</title>

      <description>Having finished up the suspension (minus coilovers) I figured the next logical step would be to dive into the engine bay. I&amp;rsquo;m itching to start on the engine bay body work but I felt it&amp;rsquo;d be smarter to address every existing issue, and figure out how/where everything would mount up prior to spraying any paint.</description>

      <title>Revival of the Hatch Part 6: Overhauling the Suspension</title>

      <description>The suspension on my hatch was in rough shape. Nearly every bushings was ripped, the ball joints were original and questionable at best, and all of the various suspension arms were covered in rust and some still had over spray on them from when we painted the car years ago.</description>

      <description>With so many spots that needed to be addressed in the engine bay it was hard to pick where to start. To break the ice I decided to start with a small first step of unshaving the headlight adjuster holes that I had accidentally shaved.</description>

      <description>Even with the motor and transmission already pulled there was still a good chunk of parts that needed to be removed from the chassis.

      <description>The B20B I pulled out of the Civic was still perfectly healthy and didn&amp;rsquo;t really need much.
But I figured why not go the extra mile and repaint it with some proper enamel since the original paint I sprayed had just about burnt off it, and I also wanted to replace a couple gaskets while I was at it.</description>

      <description>Itching to take a break from all the metal work I&amp;rsquo;ve been doing on my XJ, I decided to start with the transmission for my civic. There&amp;rsquo;s nothing actually wrong with it, but I can&amp;rsquo;t resist adding an LSD to it.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve owned my 1993 Civic Hatch for about 8 years now but it&amp;rsquo;s sat neglected in my shop for the last 3. It was my first real project car, and the car I learned how to do almost everything on.</description>

      <description># Ten months of work finally pays off I enjoy working on my own vehicles but by far the best part is finishing up. While it took longer than I hoped, and the deadlines I kept setting for myself came and went I can say it was worth the wait.</description>

      <description># Getting ready for the test drive While the car may not be on the road yet, it&amp;rsquo;s come quite a bit closer to getting there. Lately I&amp;rsquo;ve been working on fixing everything that was sub-optimally done previously by me.</description>

      <description># Connecting the Pieces It&amp;rsquo;s easy to forget just how many parts you&amp;rsquo;ve removed until it comes time to put them all back together. I know I&amp;rsquo;m probably not alone when I say I&amp;rsquo;ve fallen victim to scope creep many times now.</description>

      <description># Getting Closer. I ran into a few set backs this weekend, and I&amp;rsquo;m a little annoyed but at the same time the civic is really close to being done. I started off by prepping the transmission and engine for being mated together.</description>

      <description># Restoring the transmission My girlfriend and I went on a road trip to Vermont to pick up this transmission. Funny enough I wasn&amp;rsquo;t able to find only a transmission so I had to buy a B18b1 engine to get this guy.</description>

      <description># New Transmission Mount Installed Progress wise not too much more has been done on the Civic this week. I had to help out my girlfriend put new front brakes + an oil change so I wasn&amp;rsquo;t feeling too motivated after that.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been quite busy working on the Civic in the past month. I&amp;rsquo;m verfy excited to shared the journey I&amp;rsquo;m embarking on, and can&amp;rsquo;t wait to see how the finished product looks.</description>

      <description>I don&amp;rsquo;t know why, but I&amp;rsquo;ve always been a fan of Honda. I just love the simplicity, and elegant styling. Sure they may not be the most luxurious cars out there but they are reliable and that&amp;rsquo;s a fact.</description>

      <description>The transmission in the Civic was a good deal for the price of $100, but it had a nasty grind anytime you shifted into 3rd gear above 3k RPM. Because of this, and a transmission popping up for sale for $75 bucks I couldn&amp;rsquo;t resist making the switch.</description>
