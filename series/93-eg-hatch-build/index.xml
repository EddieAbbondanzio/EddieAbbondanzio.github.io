      <title>Two Seasons of Autocross Under It&#39;s Belt</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Civic has completed almost two full seasons of auto cross without any major issues and has been an absolute blast to drive. I&amp;rsquo;ve been slowly making changes to it so I could see how each change feels and at this point I think it&amp;rsquo;s about perfect for my driving style.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>A Custom Rear Hitch To Haul My Mini Bike</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/post/civic/custom-rear-hitch-receiver/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I recently built a &lt;a href=&#34;http://localhost:1313/post/shop/mini-bike-build/&#34;&gt;mini bike&lt;/a&gt; and needed a way to haul it around with my 93 Civic hatch. Even though the bike is small enough that it&amp;rsquo;d fit inside the Civic, I&amp;rsquo;d have to lay it sideways and I didn&amp;rsquo;t like that because it could potentially leak oil or gas so I figured my best option would be to use a hitch cargo tray.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>ASR 24mm Rear Sway Bar and Brace Install</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;After having ran several autocross events with the Civic, I felt it was time to add a rear sway bar. The Civic was handling good on the course but I didn&amp;rsquo;t care for the understeer it had and adding a rear sway bar would be the easiest way to take care of that.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Wrapping up the Civic has not been an easy task. The to-do list is basically finished at this point, but since I&amp;rsquo;ve started taking it on short test drives I&amp;rsquo;ve uncovered a few issues that need to be fixed.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;After 9 months of work the Civic is just about done! It feels pretty weird knowing I&amp;rsquo;ll be shifting focus to another project after spending so much time on it. I&amp;rsquo;m not 100% sure what I&amp;rsquo;ll pivot to next, but I&amp;rsquo;m most likely going to work on the Integra next as it needs a major tune up to be ready for the 2024 autocross season.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Revival of the Hatch Part 21: Jamming out the Cabin Harness so I Can Put the Dash Back In</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The two biggest lessons I&amp;rsquo;ve learned from all the wiring I&amp;rsquo;ve been doing on the Civic are to always double check your work at each step, and try to wire at a desk whenever possible instead of kneeling next to, or inside a car.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Revival of the Hatch Part 20: Wiring Some DIY Headlight / Radiator Relay Harnesses and Power Door Harnesses </title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Planning out how to wire up the headlights and radiator fan took some time as my new fan had a higher amp rating which meant I couldn&amp;rsquo;t use the stock wiring, and the Denji headlights also required beefier wiring since the low beam bulbs are 55 watt.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In an effort to knock down the size of my TODO list I&amp;rsquo;ve been trying to wrap up the exterior of the car. Plus with how close the exterior is to being done I&amp;rsquo;ve been itching to see how the car is gonna look all buttoned up.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Revival of the Hatch Part 18: Finalizing the New Brakes</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The brakes are officially finished on the car and I figured it was time to post up an overview of them. Previously the car had DX brakes with drums in the rear that were a horrible eyesore, but since I had been wanting brakes with more oomph, it was a no brainer to switch over to a full EX / Integra setup.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Revival of the Hatch Part 17: Cleaning up the Cabin Harness and Installing Hood Pins</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The cabin harness has been giving me some grief because there&amp;rsquo;s too much wiring underneath where the dash will sit and it&amp;rsquo;s preventing the HVAC system from fitting. The main issue is that since the engine is wired up via a standalone engine harness there&amp;rsquo;s a lot of unused connectors and wires sitting inside the cabin.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Digging into the smaller details of the car has been pretty enjoyable. Most of the small things I&amp;rsquo;m working on aren&amp;rsquo;t necessary for getting the car back on the road, but it&amp;rsquo;s given me a chance to address all the minor issues the car has had for years.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s a relief having finished up all the bodywork on the Civic but I&amp;rsquo;m starting to feel short on time with the beginning of the race seasoning looming closer and closer. The project is approaching the finish line, but at a high level I still need to:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Having spent so much time on bodywork when prepping the engine bay for paint, I&amp;rsquo;ve been resisting doing anymore of it just because I&amp;rsquo;m somewhat burnt out from it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Sadly though I&amp;rsquo;ve come to realize the remaining bodywork that needs to be done in the engine bay, roof gutters, and hatch area is blocking almost all of the other work I need to do on it so I had to bite the bullet and finally finish it up.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I couldn&amp;rsquo;t resist splurging and picking up a set of Denji headlights for the hatch.&#xA;&lt;div class=&#34;image&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;a href=&#34;images/0.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&#xA;  &lt;img loading=&#34;lazy&#34; src=&#34;images/0.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; title=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&#xA;&lt;/a&gt;&#xA;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The OEM headlights aren&amp;rsquo;t that bad with their light output for halogen units, but I wanted a set of Denji&amp;rsquo;s because I plan on eventually doing a HID projector retrofit with a set of RX-330 projectors I&amp;rsquo;ve had laying around for years and Denji&amp;rsquo;s are perfect for that.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;As of lately it&amp;rsquo;s been hard for me to see the overall progress being made on the hatch because I&amp;rsquo;m working on too many small steps simultaneously.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately that&amp;rsquo;s just the nature of the beast when it comes to this phase of a project car as you tend to uncover more and more things that need to be done while working through your TODO list. It&amp;rsquo;s all too easy to dive into another step before finishing the one your currently on.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Before dropping in the motor, I wanted to make sure there wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be any surprises during re-assembly so I went through the engine bay and cleaned up every bolt / access hole. I found that a lot of the holes had paint built up in them so I used a couple taps and a deburring tool to clean everything up.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Bodywork is probably my least favorite step when it comes to a project. It takes a ton of time and it often feels like your just going in circles. I&amp;rsquo;m grateful I didn&amp;rsquo;t have to worry about painting the entire vehicle but even just doing the engine bay I spent somewhere around 120 hours on it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Revival of the Hatch Part 8: Raptor Lining the Front Wheel Wells and Finishing the Firewall</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I made a mistake in the wheel wells. I had initially planned to leave portions of the OEM undercoating since it was so difficult to remove, and would use bed liner to recoat everything else that I had stripped, but I didn&amp;rsquo;t consider how it&amp;rsquo;d be next to impossible to blend the two together.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Having finished up the suspension (minus coilovers) I figured the next logical step would be to dive into the engine bay. I&amp;rsquo;m itching to start on the engine bay body work but I felt it&amp;rsquo;d be smarter to address every existing issue, and figure out how/where everything would mount up prior to spraying any paint.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The suspension on my hatch was in rough shape. Nearly every bushings was ripped, the ball joints were original and questionable at best, and all of the various suspension arms were covered in rust and some still had over spray on them from when we painted the car years ago.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;With so many spots that needed to be addressed in the engine bay it was hard to pick where to start. To break the ice I decided to start with a small first step of unshaving the headlight adjuster holes that I had accidentally shaved.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The B20B I pulled out of the Civic was still perfectly healthy and didn&amp;rsquo;t really need much.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But I figured why not go the extra mile and repaint it with some proper enamel since the original paint I sprayed had just about burnt off it, and I also wanted to replace a couple gaskets while I was at it.&#xA;&lt;div class=&#34;image&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;a href=&#34;images/1.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&#xA;  &lt;img loading=&#34;lazy&#34; src=&#34;images/1.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; title=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&#xA;&lt;/a&gt;&#xA;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

While it took longer than I hoped, and the deadlines I kept setting for myself came and went I can say it was worth the wait. Today was the second day of driving, and started off with topping off the tank. It hadn&amp;rsquo;t been gassed up since last September and was pretty much on E.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2&gt;&#xA;  Getting ready for the test drive&#xA;  &lt;a href=&#34;#getting-ready-for-the-test-drive&#34; id=&#34;getting-ready-for-the-test-drive&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34; aria-hidden=&#34;true&#34;&gt;&lt;i class=&#34;fa fa-link&#34;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&#xA;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the car may not be on the road yet, it&amp;rsquo;s come quite a bit closer to getting there. Lately I&amp;rsquo;ve been working on&#xA;fixing everything that was sub-optimally done previously by me. One of the things I didn&amp;rsquo;t do quite right was the clutch pedal pin.&#xA;Since the car was an automatic initially, I had to source out some parts for the swap. I ended up buying just a generic pin for the clutch master&#xA;cylinder to hook it to the clutch pedal. Interestingly enough the metal was fairly soft as the pedal has worn a fairly noticable&#xA;grove into the pin itself.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

While it may not be the fastest car out there I do enjoy riving it. I had the chance to work on it a bit more this weekend. To get myself motivated I started by getting the radiator mounted in place. After that I wired up the charge harness.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

I know I&amp;rsquo;m probably not alone when I say I&amp;rsquo;ve fallen victim to scope creep many times now. In the end you always tell yourself never again yet it keeps happening&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

I started off by prepping the transmission and engine for being mated together.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2&gt;&#xA;  Restoring the transmission&#xA;  &lt;a href=&#34;#restoring-the-transmission&#34; id=&#34;restoring-the-transmission&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34; aria-hidden=&#34;true&#34;&gt;&lt;i class=&#34;fa fa-link&#34;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&#xA;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;My girlfriend and I went on a road trip to Vermont to pick up this transmission. Funny enough I wasn&amp;rsquo;t able to find only a transmission so I had to buy a B18b1 engine to get this guy. I didn&amp;rsquo;t really want to do a B18 swap however so I managed to sell off the engine (for stupid cheap&amp;hellip;). Here&amp;rsquo;s how it looked before touching it at all. The dust shield got a little mangled up but a hammer &amp;rsquo;taps&amp;rsquo; with the hammer straightened it out.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

I had to help out my girlfriend put new front brakes + an oil change so I wasn&amp;rsquo;t feeling too motivated after that. My Dad helped out and welded in the new transmission bracket though. It came out pretty awesome and should (hopefully) have no problem mounting up the B swap.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

I spent today going over the motor ensuring I had everything I needed for it. Turns out I was missing quite a few bolts, and some misc small things.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

My civic is a 1993 DX hatch that I picked up off a friend of a friend 3 years ago. When I first bought it, it was an automatic and 100% stock. Cut to today and it&amp;rsquo;s totally different, it&amp;rsquo;s gone through rust repair, a paint job, and currently another motor swap. If your interested in it&amp;rsquo;s full history check &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.d-series.org/forums/showcase/273858-my-first-honda-build-93-hatch.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;out my build thread on D-Series.org&lt;/a&gt;. Currently however it looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Now that I&amp;rsquo;m back at college it&amp;rsquo;s been hard to make progress on the Civic. I do have a slight update to drop as the hood is just about done now.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been quite busy working on the Civic in the past month. I&amp;rsquo;m verfy excited to shared the journey I&amp;rsquo;m embarking on, and can&amp;rsquo;t wait to see how the finished product looks.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t know why, but I&amp;rsquo;ve always been a fan of Honda. I just love the simplicity, and elegant styling. Sure they may not be the most luxurious cars out there but they are reliable and that&amp;rsquo;s a fact.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The transmission in the Civic was a good deal for the price of $100, but it had a nasty grind anytime you shifted into 3rd gear above 3k RPM. Because of this, and a transmission popping up for sale for $75 bucks I couldn&amp;rsquo;t resist making the switch.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
