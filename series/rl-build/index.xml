      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been fairly quiet since I&amp;rsquo;ve just been enjoying the car. I&amp;rsquo;ve moved up North for college and have decided to sell the RL. There&amp;rsquo;s nothing wrong with it I&amp;rsquo;m just bored of it.</description>

      <description>The fog lights were a little too squarish for my taste so I made some custom overlays to give them a slight &amp;ldquo;curve&amp;rdquo;. The grill is also the custom debadged one I made a couple months back.</description>

      <description>With a stock exhaust the car was fairly quiet. I decided it was time to let the 3.5 V6 under the hood make some noise and ordered a Borla exhaust.</description>

      <description>The RL looks nice but a luxury sedan should really have some tint to it. Initially I planned on doing 35% all around but they shipped me the wrong tint so it ended up with 5% in the rear.</description>

      <description>Made a little more progress on the tablet. I&amp;rsquo;m using a Nexus 7 Gen 2 tablet.
 
I had to open up the tablet to solder in wires to the power button.</description>

      <description>In 2002 the RL came with clear corner tail lights. I&amp;rsquo;ve been envious of the since my 1999 features amber corners but tail lights on Ebay are too expensive.</description>

      <description>For 1999 the RL was pretty advanced. It came fitted with a built in GPS system that was probably pretty slick for it&amp;rsquo;s time. However, it hasn&amp;rsquo;t aged too well and is no longer really useful with out of date maps and it&amp;rsquo;s failing hard drive.</description>

      <description>The projector retrofit is finally coming to an end.

There isn&amp;rsquo;t too much gap between the reflector and shroud which isn&amp;rsquo;t too bad.

The new D2S bulbs also came in.</description>

      <description>I decided to re add the defusers over the blinkers. It looks better in my opinion and feels more OEM.
 
Ran into a slight set back. The caps on the back of the headlights are too shallow and will need some modifications.</description>

      <description>I like doing little things to fix things up. The speaker grills on the car are showing their age so I decided to re upholster them to look new again. Left is original, right is new.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve decided to do a projector retrofit. There&amp;rsquo;s nothing wrong with the current headlights I just really like the appeal of the crisp cutoff.

I separated the lense from the headlight house so I could begin to mount things in place.</description>

      <description>I bought my first car off my Grandmother. It&amp;rsquo;s a 1999 Acura 3.5RL in rough condition. I&amp;rsquo;ve owned it for about 3 years now and only done a few small mods to it since.</description>
