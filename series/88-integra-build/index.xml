      <description>With the headgasket and timing belt swap fully completed it feels like the rest of this project will be a piece of cake. Fabricating a custom exhaust is the last major task on the list and I&amp;rsquo;m looking forward to it because that means I have an excuse to break out my welder.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s been just under a month since my last post about fixing up this Integra and I&amp;rsquo;ve made a ton of progress. I&amp;rsquo;ve successfully completed replacing most of the suspension including all four shocks, outer tie rods, ball joints, sway bar bushings, cv axles, and front lower control arms.</description>

      <description>With February quickly approaching, I&amp;rsquo;m starting to feel like I&amp;rsquo;m running short on time to get my recently acquired 1988 Acura Integra road ready. My current goal is to have this vehicle on the road for spring and it&amp;rsquo;s been harder to make progress on it than anticipated.</description>

      <description>Last weekend I had the opportunity to purchase a bone stock 1988 Acura Integra from it&amp;rsquo;s original owner. The previous owner is a family friend of ours and has had this sitting in his garage for over 9 years now.</description>
