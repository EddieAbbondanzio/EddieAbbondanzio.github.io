      <description>Building a B20 VTEC (aka B20V) isn&amp;rsquo;t much more difficult than building a normal B20 but it can be daunting to figure out what you&amp;rsquo;ll need for parts with so many different options out there.</description>

      <title>OBD0 Check Engine Light Codes</title>
      <link>https://eddieabbondanz.io/post/honda/obd0-cel-codes/</link>

      <description>Reading CEL codes for an OBD0 Honda is easy since you don&amp;rsquo;t need to jump a service connector like the OBD1 Hondas, but you do need to find the ECU so you can count how many times the red LED in the ECU blinks.</description>

      <description>There&amp;rsquo;s only 6 capacitors in the 1988 - 1989 Integra ECU but getting to them can be a pain since the ECU is hidden underneath the passenger seat. The parts list required is as follows:</description>

      <title>How to tell if a B20B is high compression</title>
      <link>https://eddieabbondanz.io/post/honda/low-comp-or-high-comp-b20b/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 27 May 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://eddieabbondanz.io/post/honda/low-comp-or-high-comp-b20b/</guid>
      <description>The B20B came in a few different versions. There&amp;rsquo;s a low compression one, a high compression one, and a third variant with the P8R head.
Distinguishing a low comp engine from a high comp engine is a little tricky since they don&amp;rsquo;t have any obvious markings but there is two things you can check.</description>

      <description>Pulling CEL codes for an OBD1 Honda is actually pretty easy. All you need to do is locate the service connector (a 2 pin connector usually behind the glove box) and jump it.</description>

      <description>The ultimate list of torque specs for B18A1, B18B1, B20B, B20Z2 engines. I made this list because I was tired of digging through the 94-01 Integra and 97 - 02 CRV factory service manuals to find them all.</description>

      <description>Converting an EG Civic from manual to power windows, locks, and mirrors by building your own wiring harnesses is a moderately challenging task as it&amp;rsquo;ll require you to pull the dash, gut the doors, remove the fenders, dig into the main cabin harness, and get overly familiar with the wiring of the car, but it&amp;rsquo;s definitely doable and the results are well worth it.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m in the middle of swapping a B20B into my 1993 civic, and I had to buy (just about) every bolt / nut on the engine and transmission since I was missing so many.</description>
