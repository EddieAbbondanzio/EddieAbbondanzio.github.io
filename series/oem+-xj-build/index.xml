      <description>Having just passed 215k miles, the XJ from Colorado has proven to be a reliable daily over the past few months.

      <description>Back in June of 2024, the night before I was due to fly out to Colorado for a work trip I couldn&amp;rsquo;t resist sifting through the Denver Craigslist to see what I could find.</description>
