      <description>I&#39;ve been fairly quiet since I&#39;ve just been enjoying the car. I&#39;ve moved up North for college and have decided to sell the RL. There&#39;s nothing wrong with it I&#39;m just bored of it. I really want something that can be modded a little more. There&#39;s almost no aftermarket support for the RL so everything has to be done custom.
It took a month to sell but this is the last pic of it.</description>

      <description>The fog lights were a little too squarish for my taste so I made some custom overlays to give them a slight &amp;ldquo;curve&amp;rdquo;. The grill is also the custom debadged one I made a couple months back.
On the newer RLs they came with paint matched side skirts. I decided I want them as well.
Not bad for spray paint. This was after hitting them with a buff.
I also made another custom debadged grill.</description>

      <description>With a stock exhaust the car was fairly quiet. I decided it was time to let the 3.5 V6 under the hood make some noise and ordered a Borla exhaust.
Lou&#39;s Exhaust in Portland did the install job. He even made some custom tips for it. I really like how it&#39;s tucked up nice and high and can&#39;t be seen.
Overall it sounds nice albeit a little loud.</description>

      <description>The RL looks nice but a luxury sedan should really have some tint to it. Initially I planned on doing 35% all around but they shipped me the wrong tint so it ended up with 5% in the rear.
This was my first time tinting, and has a few flaws but I&#39;m happy with the outcome.</description>

      <description>Made a little more progress on the tablet. I&#39;m using a Nexus 7 Gen 2 tablet.
I had to open up the tablet to solder in wires to the power button. Other than that everything is 100% stock.
Installed. I was hoping to match the bezel closer to the radio but it was pretty hard finding the right black.
Winter shot.
I love the color that the projectors give off. That and the custom lighting in the cluster is a how upgrade over the stock setup.</description>

      <description>In 2002 the RL came with clear corner tail lights. I&#39;ve been envious of the since my 1999 features amber corners but tail lights on Ebay are too expensive.
I decided to cut open my tail lights and remove the amber manually. I also made custom sequential blinkers with Cree LEDs that are bright as hell.
I really like how they came out. I&#39;m a huge fan of the minimalistic look and the tail lights paired with the debadge of the &amp;ldquo;Acura&amp;rdquo; logo looks nice.</description>

      <description>For 1999 the RL was pretty advanced. It came fitted with a built in GPS system that was probably pretty slick for it&#39;s time. However, it hasn&#39;t aged too well and is no longer really useful with out of date maps and it&#39;s failing hard drive. I&#39;ve decided to attempt a tablet retrofit using the bezel of a newer GPS system that came in the 2002+ RL.
This is after seperating the rest of the GPS display from the bezel.</description>

      <description>The projector retrofit is finally coming to an end.
There isn&#39;t too much gap between the reflector and shroud which isn&#39;t too bad.
The new D2S bulbs also came in. They&#39;re much brighter than the D2Rs. Vertical height is different because I didn&#39;t bother to align that since it was so cold out. All glare in the second photo is due to the ice, and lack of shrouds around the projectors.</description>

      <description>I decided to re add the defusers over the blinkers. It looks better in my opinion and feels more OEM.
Ran into a slight set back. The caps on the back of the headlights are too shallow and will need some modifications. My desk is a mess right now.
I made some cuts with a dremel and then used the heat gun to reshape the cap to give more clearance.</description>

      <description>I like doing little things to fix things up. The speaker grills on the car are showing their age so I decided to re upholster them to look new again. Left is original, right is new.
I did a test fit of how everything will look. I&#39;m liking how it&#39;s coming out but I may re-install my side blinker defusers as I don&#39;t like the look as much due to the projector.</description>

      <description>I&#39;ve decided to do a projector retrofit. There&#39;s nothing wrong with the current headlights I just really like the appeal of the crisp cutoff.
I separated the lense from the headlight house so I could begin to mount things in place. Took a little bit of work with the heat gun but I managed to remove them safely.
Test fit of the Apollo shroud.
Future look to come.
The shrouds needed a little trimming to fit in place but things are starting to look good.</description>

      <description>I bought my first car off my Grandmother. It&#39;s a 1999 Acura 3.5RL in rough condition. I&#39;ve owned it for about 3 years now and only done a few small mods to it since. Over this winter I plan on restoring it bit by bit to get it back to it&#39;s former glorly.
The photos don&#39;t really do it justice but the car has scratches and was missing paint all over the bumpers.</description>
